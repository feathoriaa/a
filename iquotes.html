<p>“Women should be respected as well! Generally speaking, men are held in great esteem in all parts of the world, so why shouldn't women have their share? Soldiers and war heroes are honored and commemorated, explorers are granted immortal fame, martyrs are revered, but how many people look upon women too as soldiers?...Women, who struggle and suffer pain to ensure the continuation of the human race, make much tougher and more courageous soldiers than all those big-mouthed freedom-fighting heroes put together!”</p><br>

<p>"The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet."</p><br>
<p>“A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion. Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side.”</p><br>

<p>"The one exclusive sign of thorough knowledge is the power of teaching."</p><br>
<p>"Learning is not child’s play; we cannot learn without pain."</p><br>
<p>“We must not listen to those who advise us 'being men to think human thoughts, and being mortal to think mortal thoughts' but must put on immortality as much as possible and strain every nerve to live according to that best part of us, which, being small in bulk, yet much more in its power and honour surpasses all else.”</p><br>
<p>"Nature does nothing in vain."</p><br>
<p>“It is absurd to hold that a man should be ashamed of an inability to defend himself with his limbs, but not ashamed of an inability to defend himself with speech and reason; for the use of rational speech is more distinctive of a human being than the use of his limbs.”</p><br>

<p>“I have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life. They seek position, marriage, reputation, outward success of money, and remain unhappy and neurotic even when they have attained what they were seeking.

<p>"Genius and madness are often indistinguishable."</p><br>
<p>“I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly indulge. It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and reputation and reason.

<p>“Sarcasm: the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the PRIVACY of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded.”</p><br>
<p>“I used to analyze myself down to the last thread, used to compare myself with others, recalled all the smallest glances, smiles and words of those to whom I’d tried to be frank, interpreted everything in a bad light, laughed viciously at my attempts ‘to be like the rest’ –and suddenly, in the midst of my laughing, I’d give way to sadness, fall into ludicrous despondency and once again start the whole process all over again – in short, I went round and round like a squirrel on a wheel.”</p><br>

And there's a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there.”</p><br>
<p>"A man who has no conscience is worse than a criminal."</p><br>
<p>"Hope is the only thing that keeps a man alive in the face of despair."</p><br>

<p>“There are no big problems, there are just a lot of little problems.”</p><br>

        <p>“All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason.”</p><br>
<p>“Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.”</p><br>
<p>“Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.”</p><br>
<p>“Live your life as though your every act were to become a universal law.”</p><br>
<p>“Always recognize that human individuals are ends, and do not use them as means to your end.”</p><br>
<p>“In law a man is guilty when he violates the rights of others. In ethics he is guilty if he only thinks of doing so.”</p><br>
<p>“A good will is good not because of what it effects, or accomplishes, not because of its fitness to attain some intended end, but good just by its willing.”</p><br>
<p>“We are not rich by what we possess but by what we can do without.”</p><br>
<p>“Seek not the favour of the multitude; it is seldom got by honest and lawful means. But seek the testimony of few; and number not voices, but weigh them.”</p><br>
<p>“Experience without theory is blind, but theory without experience is mere intellectual play.”</p><br>
<p>“Immaturity is the incapacity to use one’s intelligence without the guidance of another.”</p><br>

<p>“Ingratitude is the essence of vileness.”</p><br>
<p>“Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”</p><br>
<p>“The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.”</p><br>
<p>“Rules for happiness: something to do, someone to love, something to hope for.”</p><br>
<p>“Morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness.”</p><br>
<p>“It is beyond a doubt that all our knowledge begins with experience.”</p><br>
<p>“What can I know? What ought I to do? What may I hope?”</p><br>
<p>“Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.”</p><br>
<p>“Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity.”</p><br>
<p>“Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end.”</p><br>
<p>“The people naturally adhere most to doctrines which demand the least self‑exertion and the least use of their own reason.”</p><br>
<p>“Whereas the beautiful is limited, the sublime is limitless, so that the mind in the presence of the sublime, attempting to imagine what it cannot, has pain in the failure but pleasure in contemplating the immensity of the attempt”</p><br>
<p>“The reading of all good books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries.”</p><br>
<p>“If justice perishes, human life on Earth has lost its meaning.”</p><br>
<p>“He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.”</p><br>

<p>“Give a man everything he wants and at that moment everything is not everything.”</p><br>

<p>"Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things."</p><br>
<p>"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea‑shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."</p><br>
<p>"I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."</p><br>
<p>"Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy."</p><br>
<p>"My powers are ordinary. Only my application brings me success."</p><br>
<p>"Nature is pleased with simplicity. And nature is no dummy."</p><br>
<p>"We build too many walls and not enough bridges."</p><br>
<p>"Plato is my friend; Aristotle is my friend; but my greatest friend is truth."</p><br>
<p>"If I have ever made any valuable discoveries, it has been due more to patient attention, than to any other talent."</p><br>
<p>"Genius is patience."</p><br>
<p>"What goes up must come down."</p><br>
<p>"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction."</p><br>
<p>"An object in motion tends to remain in motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force."</p><br>
<p>"The weight, not numbers of experiments, is to be regarded."</p><br>
<p>"It is the perfection of God’s works that they are all done with the greatest simplicity. He is the God of order and not of confusion."</p><br>
<p>"We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances."</p><br>
<p>"Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who sets the planets in motion."</p><br>
<p>"To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. ’Tis much better to do a little with certainty & leave the rest for others that come after than to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing."</p><br>
<p>"The best and safest method of philosophizing seems to be first to inquire diligently into the properties of things, and establishing those properties by experiments, and then to proceed more slowly to hypotheses for the explanation of them."</p><br>
<p>"I have explained the phenomena of the heavens and of our sea by the force of gravity, but I have not yet assigned a cause to gravity."</p><br>
<p>"It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent because the parts of that immovable space, in which those motions are performed, do by no means come under the observation of our senses."</p><br>
<p>"There are more sure marks of authenticity in the Bible than in any profane history."</p><br>
<p>"I do not love to be printed on every occasion, much less to be dunned and teased by foreigners about mathematical things or to be thought by our own people to be trifling away my time about them when I should be about the king’s business."</p><br>
<p>"As a blind man has no idea of colours, so have we no idea of the manner by which the all‑wise God perceives and understands all things."</p><br>
<p>"God without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature. Blind metaphysical necessity, which is certainly the same always and everywhere, could produce no variety of things."</p><br>
<p>"Mind is the governor of the body, and no less the body of the mind; the one is active, the other passive; and into both something of the Divine enters."</p><br>
<p>"A luminous and spotless intellect leaps with delight into the truth and makes it its own. A dim and disorderly mind is frightened at the conclusion before the reason which must lead to it is perceived."</p><br>
<p>"If you are affronted it is better to pass it by in silence, or with a jest, though with some dishonor, than to endeavor revenge. If you can keep reason above passion, that and watchfulness will be your best defenders."</p><br>
<p>"In all my labours I have ever found that what I have done by hard work I could have done by patience."</p><br>
<p>"The most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being."</p><br>
<p>"We account the Scriptures of God to be the most sublime philosophy."</p><br>
<p>"Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable."</p><br>
<p>"My greatest delight is with the mathematical sciences, because the order and measures of things give me so much pleasure."</p><br>
<p>"Truth is the offspring of silence and meditation."</p><br>
<p>"Live your life as an Exclamation rather than an Explanation."</p><br>
<p>"Atheism is so senseless. When I look at the solar system, I see the earth at the right distance from the sun to receive the proper amounts of heat and light. This did not happen by chance."</p><br>
<p>"No great discovery was ever made without a bold guess."</p><br>
<p>"All my discoveries have been made in answer to prayer."</p><br>
<p>"If I have done the public any service, it is due to my patient thought."</p><br>
<p>"The proper method for inquiring after the properties of things is to deduce them from experiments."</p><br>
<p>"The motions which the planets now have could not spring from any natural cause alone, but were impressed by an intelligent Agent."</p><br>
<p>"God created everything by number, weight and measure."</p><br>
<p>"Faith is the guide, but reason is the judge."</p><br>
<p>"I see I have made myself a slave to Philosophy."</p><br>
<p>"Infinites, when considered absolutely without any restriction or limitation, are neither equal nor unequal, nor have any certain proportion one to another…”</p><br>
<p>"We must believe in one God that we may love & fear him. We must believe that he is the father Almighty, or first author of all things by the almighty power of his will…”</p><br>
<p>"The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, and they observe the same laws as the motions of the planets, but they differ from the motions of vortices in every particular and are often contrary to them."</p><br>
<p>"God made and governs the world invisibly, and has commanded us to love and worship him and no other God; to honor our parents and masters, and love our neighbours as ourselves…”</p><br>
<p>"The moon gravitates towards the earth and by the force of gravity is continually drawn off from a rectilinear motion and retained in its orbit."</p><br>
<p>"God is the same God, always and everywhere. He is omnipresent not virtually only, but also substantially, for virtue cannot subsist without substance."</p><br>

        <p>"Freedom and love go together. Love is not a reaction. If I love you because you love me, that is mere trade… To love is not to ask anything in return, not even to feel that you are giving something—and it is only such love that can know freedom."</p><br>
<p>"One is never afraid of the unknown; one is afraid of the known coming to an end."</p><br>
<p>"The more you know yourself, the more clarity there is. Self‑knowledge has no end — you don’t come to an achievement, you don’t come to a conclusion. It is an endless river."</p><br>
<p>"Tradition becomes our security, and when the mind is secure it is in decay."</p><br>
<p>"The ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence."</p><br>
<p>"If you begin to understand what you are without trying to change it, then what you are undergoes a transformation."</p><br>
<p>"You can only be afraid of what you think you know."</p><br>
<p>"No one can live without relationship. You may withdraw into the mountains… but you are related. You cannot escape from that absolute fact."</p><br>
<p>"It is truth that liberates, not your effort to be free."</p><br>
<p>"When you are brought face to face with yourself — your joys, your sorrows, your guilt, your fear — your ‘problems’ vanish because you are deeply, utterly, aware. Then you are free from all this misery and conflict."</p><br>
<p>"The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed."</p><br>
<p>"Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong, but just to watch it and move with it."</p><br>
<p>"Thought is so cunning, so clever, that it distorts everything for its own convenience."</p><br>
<p>"To be free of all authority, of your own and that of another, is to die to everything of yesterday…" "</p><br>
<p>"You must look most intimately and discover for yourself; then it is your own, not somebody else’s, not something that you have been told, because there is no teacher and no follower."</p><br>
<p>"What is needed, rather than running away or controlling or suppressing or any other resistance, is understanding fear; that means, watch it, learn about it, come directly into contact with it."</p><br>
<p>"Life is movement, endless and unmeasured."</p><br>
<p>"Living in the present is the instant perception of beauty and the great delight in it without seeking pleasure from it."</p><br>
<p>"True education is to learn how to think, not what to think."</p><br>
<p>"The demand to be safe in relationship inevitably breeds sorrow and fear."</p><br>
<p>"The day you teach the child the name of the bird, the child will never see that bird again."</p><br>
<p>"A mind that is full of conclusions is a dead mind."</p><br>
<p>"You cannot invite truth. You must be free from all your prejudices to see it."</p><br>
<p>"We are second‑hand people. We have lived on what we have been told… We are the result of all kinds of influences, and there is nothing new in us."</p><br>
<p>"What you are, the world is. And without your transformation, there can be no transformation of the world."</p><br>
<p>"In oneself lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn, the door is there and the key is in your hand."</p><br>
<p>"The question of whether or not there is a God or truth or reality … can never be answered by books, by priests, philosophers or saviours. Nobody and nothing can answer the question but you yourself…"</p><br>
<p>"When the mind is silent, love blossoms."</p><br>
<p>"To live without comparison is to truly live."</p><br>
<p>"A society built on ambition and greed cannot sustain peace."</p><br>
<p>"Education must help the individual to discover their uniqueness, and from there, to live freely."</p><br>
<p>"Fear is not part of life; it is created by the mind."</p><br>
<p>"Life has no meaning except the meaning you give to it through understanding."</p><br>
<p>"To understand the immeasurable, the mind must be extraordinarily quiet, still."</p><br>
<p>"You may be educated abroad, you may be a great scientist, politician, but you always have a sneaking fear that if you don’t do the ordinary things… you conform. What happens to the mind that conforms? Investigate it, please."</p><br>
<p>"What brings understanding is love. When your heart is full, then you will listen to the teacher, to the beggar, to the laughter of children… Under every stone and leaf, that which is eternal exists."</p><br>
<p>"As human beings in this monstrously ugly world, let us ask ourselves, can this society, based on competition, brutality and fear, come to an end? Not as an intellectual conception, not as a hope, but as an actual fact…" </p><br>
<p>"When thought and action are the same, then we have order; but when thought and action are different, we enter rebellion, conflict, doubt, fear and sorrow."</p><br>
<p>"Do you know that even when you look at a tree and say, ‘That is an oak tree’, the naming of the tree… has so conditioned your mind that the word comes between you and actually seeing the tree?"</p><br>
<p>"It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society."</p><br>
<p>"Freedom is not given to you by someone; you have to cultivate it yourself."</p><br>
<p>"Self‑knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, which is the ending of fear."</p><br>
<p>"The very essence of education is to bring about a total transformation of the human being — not merely to instruct or train." </p><br>
<p>"Happiness is strange; it comes when you are not seeking it."</p><br>
<p>"Truth is a pathless land."</p><br>
<p>"Observation without judgment is the greatest revolution in the mind." </p><br>
<p>"What is important is to ask the right question and never be satisfied with the answer… the mind that asks a question and is merely satisfied with an explanation remains superficial."</p><br>
<p>"The moment you follow someone, you cease to follow truth."</p><br>
<p>"The highest form of human intelligence is to observe yourself without judgment."</p><br>
<p>"To transform the world, we must begin with ourselves; and what is important is the relationship between the two."</p><br>
<p>"Intelligence is the capacity to observe without the distortion of thought."</p><br>
<p>"Learning to be alone is the beginning of freedom."</p><br>
<p>"It is only in silence that the mind can discover what is true."</p><br>
<p>"To understand another is to understand oneself."</p><br>
<p>“When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”</p><br>
<p>"The mind that is free from the known sees the new, and the new is truth."</p><br>
<p>"Insight is seeing clearly without any filter of opinion or desire."</p><br>
<p>"When you are aware of fear, it loses its power over you."</p><br>
<p>"Action without self-interest is the highest form of living."</p><br>
<p>"To truly listen is to understand the world as it is, not as you wish it to be."</p><br>
<p>"The thinker is the consequence of society; he cannot create freedom."</p><br>
<p>"Awareness is the art of living fully in each moment."</p><br>
<p>"Truth is not a matter of belief; it is a matter of direct perception."</p><br>
<p>"The mind that asks questions without seeking answers remains alive."</p><br>
<p>"When the mind is fully attentive, disorder disappears."</p><br>
<p>"Love is not possession; it is the understanding of another without desire."</p><br>
<p>"One cannot escape from life; one can only understand it completely."</p><br>
<p>"Clinging to the past prevents the mind from seeing what is real."</p><br>
<p>"The real question is not whether there is truth, but whether you are willing to see it."</p><br>

<p>"We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to accept the one that is waiting for us."</p><br>
<p>"The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek."</p><br>
<p>"Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors for you where there were only walls."</p><br>
<p>"The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are."</p><br>
<p>"The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe, to match your nature with Nature."</p><br>
<p>"Your life is the fruit of your own doing. You have no one to blame but yourself."</p><br>
<p>"It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure."</p><br>
<p>"Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging."</p><br>
<p>"Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world. We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy."</p><br>
<p>"I don’t believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive."</p><br>
<p>"All the gods, all the heavens, all the hells, are within you."</p><br>
<p>“If you do follow your bliss you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.”</p><br>
<p>"Myths are public dreams, dreams are private myths."</p><br>
<p>"Every religion is true one way or another. It is true when understood metaphorically. But when it gets stuck in its own metaphors, interpreting them as facts, then you are in trouble."</p><br>
<p>"You are more than you think you are. There are dimensions of your being and a potential for realization and consciousness that are not included in your concept of yourself."</p><br>
<p>"What is required is the finding of that Immovable Point within one's self, which is not shaken by any of those tempests which the Buddhists call 'the eight karmic winds'.’"</p><br>
<p>"The hero's journey is inside of you; tear off the veils and open the mystery of your self."</p><br>
<p>"Life is not a problem to be solved but a mystery to be lived."</p><br>
<p>“People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.”</p><br>
<p>"You enter the forest at the darkest point, where there is no path."</p><br>
<p>"When we quit thinking primarily about ourselves and our own self‑preservation, we undergo a truly heroic transformation of consciousness."</p><br>
<p>"Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again."</p><br>
<p>“Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.”</p><br>
<p>"There is an important difference between the Hindu and the Western ideas. We are the sparks from a single fire. And we are all fire."</p><br>
<p>"Life is without meaning. You bring the meaning to it. The meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be. Being alive is the meaning."</p><br>
<p>"If you are on the right path you will find that invisible hands are helping."</p><br>
<p>“We're so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget the inner value, the rapture that is associated with being alive, is what it is all about.”</p><br>
<p>"We have not even to risk the adventure alone, for the heroes of all time have gone before us."</p><br>
<p>“When you find a writer who really is saying something to you, read everything that writer has written and you will get more education and depth of understanding out of that than reading a scrap here and a scrap there and elsewhere. Then go to people who influenced that writer, or those who were related to him, and your world builds together in an organic way that is really marvelous.”</p><br>
<p>"Where we had thought to travel outward, we will come to the center of our own existence."</p><br>
<p>"When you make the sacrifice in marriage, you're sacrificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship."</p><br>
<p>"Love is a friendship set to music."</p><br>
<p>“The first step to the knowledge of the wonder and mystery of life is the recognition of the monstrous nature of the earthly human realm as well as its glory, the realization that this is just how it is and that it cannot and will not be changed. Those who think they know how the universe could have been had they created it, without pain, without sorrow, without time, without death, are unfit for illumination.”</p><br>
<p>"The world becomes a display of things from which you are disengaged, and yet, voluntarily, you can become engaged: 'joyous participation in the sorrows of the world.’"</p><br>
<p>"There is no dragon without treasure, and no treasure without a dragon to protect it."</p><br>
<p>"The ego is as you think of yourself. The self is the whole range of possibilities that you've never even thought of."</p><br>
<p>“Just as anyone who listens to the muse will hear, you can write out of your own intention or out of inspiration. There is such a thing. It comes up and talks. And those who have heard deeply the rhythms and hymns of the gods, can recite those hymns in such a way that the gods will be attracted.”</p><br>
<p>"When the world seems to be falling apart, stick to your own trajectory; hang onto your own ideals and find kindred spirits."</p><br>
<p>“Mythology is not a lie, mythology is poetry, it is metaphorical. It has been well said that mythology is the penultimate truth--penultimate because the ultimate cannot be put into words. It is beyond words. Beyond images, beyond that bounding rim of the Buddhist Wheel of Becoming. Mythology pitches the mind beyond that rim, to what can be known but not told.”</p><br>
<p>"Don’t do anything that isn’t play."</p><br>
<p>"It takes courage to do what you want. Other people have a lot of plans for you... But you must do what you want."</p><br>
<p>"What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea. It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience, something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else."</p><br>
<p>"The goal of the hero is to see within himself that which he sought outside."</p><br>
<p>"You become mature when you become the authority of your own life."</p><br>
<p>"It is ironic that our great Western civilization, which has opened to the minds of all mankind the infinite wonders of a universe of untold billions of galaxies should be saddled with the tightest little cosmological image known to mankind."</p><br>
<p>"The goal of life is to be a vehicle for something higher."</p><br>
<p>“Every religion is true one way or another. It is true when understood metaphorically. But when it gets stuck in its own metaphors, interpreting them as facts, then you are in trouble.”</p><br>
<p>"Sit in a room and read—and read and read. And read the right books by the right people. Your mind is brought onto that level, and you have a nice, mild, slow‑burning rapture all the time."</p><br>
<p>"The adventure of the hero represents the moment in his life when he achieved illumination—while still alive, he found and opened the road to the light beyond the dark walls of our living death."</p>

        <p>"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."</p><br>
<p>"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it."</p><br>
<p>"Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains."</p><br>
<p>"Religion is the opium of the people."</p><br>
<p>"Capital is dead labour, which, vampire‑like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks."</p><br>
<p>"The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence: Abolish all private property."</p><br>
<p>"All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind."</p><br>
<p>"In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality."</p><br>
<p>"The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas."</p><br>
<p>"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs."</p><br>
<p>"Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth — the soil and the labourer."</p><br>
<p>"The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people."</p><br>
<p>"Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form."</p><br>
<p>"History is nothing but the actions of men in pursuit of their ends."</p><br>
<p>“Surround yourself with people who make you happy. People who make you laugh, who help you when you’re in need. People who genuinely care. They are the ones worth keeping in your life. Everyone else is just passing through.”</p><br>
<p>"Landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed."</p><br>
<p>"Nothing can have value without being an object of utility."</p><br>
<p>"The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie."</p><br>
<p>"Machines were, it may be said, the weapon employed by the capitalists to quell the revolt of specialised labour."</p><br>
<p>"The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal … but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society."</p><br>
<p>"We should not say that one man's hour is worth another man's hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another man during an hour."</p><br>
<p>"Surround yourself with people who make you happy. People who make you laugh, who help you when you’re in need. People who genuinely care."</p><br>
<p>"The first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion."</p><br>
<p>"Accumulation of wealth at one pole is at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole."</p><br>
<p>"The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think, love, theorise, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save — the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will devour."</p><br>
<p>"The less you are, the more you have; the less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life — the greater is the store of your estranged being."</p><br>
<p>"The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism."</p><br>
<p>"Necessity is blind until it becomes conscious. Freedom is the consciousness of necessity."</p><br>
<p>"The working class is revolutionary or it is nothing at all."</p><br>
<p>"Last words are for fools who haven’t said enough."</p><br>
<p>"Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes."</p><br>
<p>"Communism is the riddle of history solved and knows itself to be this solution."</p><br>
<p>"Money plays the largest part in determining the course of history."</p><br>
<p>"All science would be superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly coincided."</p><br>
<p>"As individuals express their life, so they are."</p><br>
<p>"The true law of economics is chance, and we learned people arbitrarily seize on a few moments and establish them as laws."</p><br>
<p>"Beauty is the main positive form of the aesthetic assimilation of reality, in which the aesthetic ideal finds its direct expression."</p><br>
<p>"It is absolutely impossible to transcend the laws of the historical development of production and exchange of material life."</p><br>
<p>"Hegel remarks somewhere that all great, world‑historical facts and personages appear, as it were, twice. He has forgotten to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce."</p><br>
<p>"The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles."</p><br>
<p>"Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win."</p><br>
<p>"Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self‑selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past."</p><br>
<p>"The more the division of labour and the application of machinery extend, the more does competition extend among the workers, the more do their wages shrink together."</p><br>
<p>"The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society."</p><br>
<p>"When the sufferers learn to think, then the thinkers will learn to suffer."</p><br>
<p>"The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win."</p><br>
<p>"Art is always and everywhere the secret confession, and at the same time the immortal movement of its time."</p><br>
<p>"In a higher phase of communist society… only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."</p><br>
<p>"The more powerful the capitalist becomes, the more he becomes a worker among other workers, and the more wage‑labour becomes the instrument of production."</p><br>
<p>"Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs."</p><br>
<p>"The idea of surplus value turns up hitherto unrecognised in the phenomenon of capital itself."</p><br>
<p>"The working class is revolutionary or it is nothing at all."</p><br>
<p>"Catch a man a fish, and you can sell it to him. Teach a man to fish, and you ruin a wonderful business opportunity."</p><br>
<p>"If you can cut the people off from their history, then they can be easily persuaded."</p><br>
<p>"Democracy is the road to socialism."</p><br>
<p>"The last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope."</p><br>
<p>"The worker may only have enough for him to want to live, and may only want to live, in order to have that."</p>

<p>"Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars."</p><br>
<p>"Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit."</p><br>
<p>"Yesterday is but today’s memory, and tomorrow is today’s dream."</p><br>
<p>"Trust in dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity."</p><br>
<p>"Generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need."</p><br>
<p>"Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart."</p><br>
<p>"You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give."</p><br>
<p>"The soul unfolds itself like a lotus of countless petals."</p><br>
<p>"No one can reveal to you nothing but that which already lies half‑asleep in the dawning of your knowledge."</p><br>
<p>"Faith is a knowledge within the heart, beyond the reach of proof."</p><br>
<p>"The smallest act of kindness is worth more than the greatest intention."</p><br>
<p>"Tenderness and kindness are not signs of weakness and despair, but manifestations of strength and resolution."</p><br>
<p>"Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy."</p><br>
<p>"For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one."</p><br>
<p>"Your children are not your children. They are sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself."</p><br>
<p>"Let there be spaces in your togetherness, And let the winds of the heavens dance between you."</p><br>
<p>"And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation."</p><br>
<p>"Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding."</p><br>
<p>"The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain."</p><br>
<p>"Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral."</p><br>
<p>"Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul."</p><br>
<p>"In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."</p><br>
<p>"Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror."</p><br>
<p>"We choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them."</p><br>
<p>“I have found both freedom and safety in my madness; the freedom of loneliness and the safety from being understood, for those who understand us enslave something in us.”</p><br>
<p>"You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth."</p><br>
<p>"The teacher who is indeed wise does not bid you to enter the house of his wisdom but rather leads you to the threshold of your mind."</p><br>
<p>"In one drop of water are found all the secrets of all the oceans."</p><br>

<p>"As a single day embraces many lives, so in a single life lie the many days of the past and the many of the future."</p><br>
<p>"When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy."</p><br>
<p>"Travel and tell no one, live a true love story and tell no one, live happily and tell no one."</p><br>
<p>“We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us. Even while the earth sleeps we travel. We are the seeds of the tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind and are scattered.”</p><br>
<p>"Solitude has its own special richness, a treasure for those who learn to listen within."</p><br>
<p>"Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens."</p><br>
<p>"Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair."</p><br>
<p>"A traveler without observation is a bird without wings."</p><br>
<p>"Your loneliness is a lantern glowing in the dark; embrace it, and it will light your path."</p><br>
<p>"The real test of good manners is to be able to put up with bad manners pleasantly."</p><br>
<p>"No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies asleep in the dawning of your knowledge."</p><br>
<p>"And ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation."</p><br>
<p>"Live for yourself–live your life. Then you are most truly the friend of man."</p><br>

<p>"Among intelligent people the surest basis for marriage is friendship — the sharing of real interests." </p><br>

<p>"Let me, O let me bathe my soul in colours; let me swallow the sunset and drink the rainbow."</p><br>

<p>"Success requires no explanations. Failure permits no alibis."</p><br>
<p>"One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat."</p><br>
<p>"You give before you get."</p><br>
<p>"Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice."</p><br>
<p>"Opportunity often comes disguised in the form of misfortune or temporary defeat."</p><br>
<p>"The man who does more than he is paid for will soon be paid for more than he does."</p><br>
<p>"Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once, whether you are ready or not."</p><br>
<p>"It is always your next move."</p><br>
<p>"The way to develop decisiveness is to start right where you are."</p><br>
<p>"First comes thought; then organization of that thought into ideas and plans; then transformation into reality."</p><br>
<p>"Plan your work and work your plan."</p><br>
<p>"An educated man is not one who has an abundance of general or specialized knowledge. He is one who has so trained his mind that he can acquire anything he wants."</p><br>
<p>"Hold a picture of yourself long and steadily enough in your mind's eye, and you will be drawn toward it."</p><br>
<p>"There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge."</p><br>
<p>"Your subconscious mind works continuously, while you are awake, and while you sleep."</p><br>
<p>"Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning."</p><br>
<p>"More gold has been mined from the thoughts of men than has ever been taken from the earth."</p><br>
<p>"Success in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment of happiness."</p><br>
<p>"No one ever is defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality."</p><br>
<p>"Tell the world what you intend to do, but first show it."</p><br>
<p>"Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat."</p><br>
<p>"Fear is the tool of a man-made devil."</p><br>
<p>"Happiness is found in doing, not merely possessing."</p><br>
<p>“An educated man is not, necessarily, one who has an abundance of general or specialized knowledge. An educated man is one who has so developed the faculties of his mind that he may acquire anything he wants, or its equivalent, without violating the rights of others.”</p><br>
<p>"A positive mind finds a way; a negative mind looks for excuses."</p><br>
<p>"Action is the real measure of intelligence."</p><br>
<p>“Before success comes in any man’s life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat, and, perhaps, some failure. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and most logical thing to do is to quit. That is exactly what the majority of men do. More than five hundred of the most successful men this country has ever known told the author their greatest success came just one step beyond the point at which defeat had overtaken them.”</p><br>
<p>"Life reflects your thoughts back to you."</p><br>
<p>"Success is good at any age, but the sooner you find it, the longer you will enjoy it."</p><br>
<p>"If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self."</p><br>
<p>“I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself.”</p><br>
<p>"The ladder of success is never crowded at the top."</p><br>
<p>“Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by "opinions" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.”</p><br>
<p>"Thoughts are things — and powerful things at that."</p><br>
<p>"Persistence is to the character of man what carbon is to steel."</p>

        <p>"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."</p><br>
<p>"I don’t care that they stole my idea… I care that they don’t have any of their own."</p><br>
<p>"The day science begins to study non‑physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence."</p><br>
<p>"Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born."</p><br>
<p>"The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane."</p><br>
<p>"My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists."</p><br>
<p>"The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine."</p><br>
<p>"If your hate could be turned into electricity, it would light up the whole world."</p><br>
<p>"I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men."</p><br>
<p>"What we now want is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination of egoism and pride … Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment…"</p><br>
<p>"Everyone should consider his body as a priceless gift from one whom he loves above all, a marvelous work of art … so delicate that a word, a breath, a look, nay, a thought may injure it."</p><br>
<p>"I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success… Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything."</p><br>
<p>"Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more."</p><br>
<p>"All that was great in the past was ridiculed, condemned, combated — only to emerge all the more powerfully, all the more triumphantly from the struggle."</p><br>
<p>"The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter — for the future."</p><br>
<p>"A point of great importance would be first to know: what is the capacity of the earth? … Throughout space there is energy. … it is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheel‑work of nature."</p><br>
<p>"When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain … We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance."</p><br>
<p>"The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. … Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences."</p><br>
<p>"Of all things, I liked books best."</p><br>
<p>"The gift of mental power comes from God, Divine Being, and if we concentrate our minds on that truth, we become in tune with this great power."</p><br>
<p>"The progress and development of man are of immeasurable importance for humanity and are essentially dependent on invention."</p><br>
<p>"A new idea must not be judged by its immediate results."</p><br>
<p>"If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe."</p><br>
<p>"Anti‑social behaviour is a trait of intelligence in a world full of conformists."</p><br>
<p>"The year 2100 will see eugenics universally established … Then man’s new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature."</p><br>
<p>"Every living being is an engine geared to the wheel‑work of the universe. Though seemingly affected only by its immediate surroundings, the sphere of external influence extends to infinite distance."</p><br>
<p>"Today’s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality."</p><br>
<p>"The spread of civilisation may be likened to a fire; first, a feeble spark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speed and power."</p><br>
<p>"The human being is a self‑propelled automaton entirely under the control of external influences."</p><br>
<p>"It seems that I have always been ahead of my time."</p><br>
<p>"I could only achieve success in my life through self‑discipline, and I applied it until my wish and my will became one."</p><br>
<p>"The practical success of an idea, irrespective of inherent possibilities, depends on the attitude of contemporaries."</p><br>
<p>"Peace in the world can only come as a natural consequence of universal illumination."</p><br>
<p>"Science is a personal perversion except if its end goal is the betterment of mankind."</p><br>
<p>"Crystals are living beings at the beginning of creation."</p><br>
<p>"All things have a frequency and a vibration."</p><br>
<p>"Of all the forces of friction the one which mostly slows down human progress is ignorance."</p><br>
<p>"We build but to tear down. Most of our work and resource is squandered. Our onward march is marked by devastation."</p><br>
<p>"We crave for new sensations but soon become indifferent to them. The wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences."</p><br>
<p>"Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves."</p><br>
<p>"As I review the events of my past life I realise how subtle are the influences that shape our destinies."</p><br>
<p>"There is something within me that might be illusion … if I would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals, it would be on behalf of the whole of humanity."</p><br>
<p>"A man is born to work, to suffer, and to fight; he who doesn’t, must perish."</p><br>
<p>"I strongly believe in the rule of compensation. True awards are always in proportion with work and sacrifices."</p><br>
<p>"The inventor finds a huge compensation in the pleasure offered by his work and in knowing that he is an individual of extraordinary capabilities without whom our species would long be extinct in the fierce struggle against merciless elements."</p><br>
<p>"Even matter which is called inorganic … responds to disbelievers and gives irrefutable proof of the living principle within itself."</p><br>
<p>"When natural inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advances towards his goal in seven‑league boots."</p><br>
<p>"An individual is transitory, races and peoples will come and go, but man remains."</p><br>
<p>"Money does not represent such a value as man has placed in it. All my money I invested in inventions which enabled new inventions enabling an easier life for humanity."</p>

<p>"Drop the idea of becoming somebody — because you are already a masterpiece."</p><br>

<p>"The way of love is the way of no expectations."</p><br>
<p>“Many people have come and left, and it has been always good because they emptied some space for better people. It is a strange experience, that those who have left me have always left places for a better quality of people. I have never been a loser”</p><br>

<p>"The only way to have a friend is to be one."</p><br>
<p>“The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand, not the kindly smile, nor the joy of companionship; it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when you discover that someone else believes in you and is willing to trust you with a friendship.”</p><br>
<p>"Always make a total effort, even when the odds are against you."</p><br>
<p>"The mind travels more slowly than the heart."</p><br>
<p>"In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man."</p><br>
<p>"Self-trust is the first secret of success."</p><br>
<p>"The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well."</p><br>
<p>"Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air."</p><br>
<p>"We aim above the mark to hit the mark."</p><br>
<p>“Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.”</p><br>
<p>"Make yourself necessary to somebody."</p><br>
<p>"The ornament of a house is the friends who frequent it."</p><br>
<p>“Be not the slave of your own past - plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep, and swim far, so you shall come back with new self-respect, with new power, and with an advanced experience that shall explain and overlook the old.”</p><br>
<p>"Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect."</p><br>
<p>"Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year."</p><br>
<p>"What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us."</p><br>
<p>“Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another. Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.”</p><br>
<p>"A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave five minutes longer."</p><br>
<p>"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."</p><br>
<p>“Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.”</p>

        <p>"I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am."</p><br>
<p>"I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want."</p><br>
<p>"And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited."</p><br>
<p>“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”</p><br>
<p>"I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket."</p><br>
<p>"The silence depressed me. It wasn’t the silence of silence. It was my own silence."</p><br>
<p>"If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at once, then I am neurotic as hell."</p><br>
<p>"I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my eyes and all is born again. (I think I made you up inside my head.)"</p><br>
<p>"The blood jet is poetry, there is no stopping it."</p><br>
<p>“And by the way, everything in life is writable about if you have the outgoing guts to do it, and the imagination to improvise. The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.”</p><br>
<p>"Kiss me, and you will see how important I am."</p><br>
<p>“Can you understand? Someone, somewhere, can you understand me a little, love me a little? For all my despair, for all my ideals, for all that - I love life. But it is hard, and I have so much - so very much to learn.”</p><br>
<p>"I must get my soul back from you; I am killing my flesh without it."</p><br>
<p>“God, but life is loneliness, despite all the opiates, despite the shrill tinsel gaiety of "parties" with no purpose, despite the false grinning faces we all wear. And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter - they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, there is joy, fulfillment and companionship - but the loneliness of the soul in its appalling self-consciousness is horrible and overpowering.”</p><br>
<p>“Perhaps when we find ourselves wanting everything, it is because we are dangerously close to wanting nothing.”</p><br>
<p>“I need a father. I need a mother. I need some older, wiser being to cry to. I talk to God, but the sky is empty.”</p><br>
<p>“Here I am, a bundle of past recollections and future dreams, knotted up in a reasonably attractive bundle of flesh. I remember what this flesh has gone through; I dream of what it may go through.”</p><br>
<p>“I like people too much or not at all. I've got to go down deep, to fall into people, to really know them.”</p><br>
<p>“I have the choice of being constantly active and happy or introspectively passive and sad. Or I can go mad by ricocheting in between.”</p><br>
<p>"The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt."</p><br>
<p>“When they asked me what I wanted to be I said I didn’t know. "Oh, sure you know," the photographer said. "She wants," said Jay Cee wittily, "to be everything.”</p><br>
<p>“I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my lids and all is born again. (I think I made you up inside my head.)”</p><br>
<p>"I desire the things that will destroy me in the end."</p><br>
<p>“Remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I’ve taken for granted.”</p><br>
<p>"The mind is a spider-web of interlacing threads."</p><br>
<p>“And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter— they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long.”</p><br>
<p>"I am inhabited by a cry."</p><br>
<p>“I didn’t want my picture taken because I was going to cry. I didn’t know why I was going to cry, but I knew that if anybody spoke to me or looked at me too closely the tears would fly out of my eyes and the sobs would fly out of my throat and I’d cry for a week. I could feel the tears brimming and sloshing in me like water in a glass that is unsteady and too full.”</p><br>
<p>“If neurotic is wanting two mutually exclusive things at one and the same time, then I'm neurotic as hell. I'll be flying back and forth between one mutually exclusive thing and another for the rest of my days.”</p><br>
<p>"I am terrified by this dark thing that sleeps in me."</p><br>
<p>“Perhaps some day I'll crawl back home, beaten, defeated. But not as long as I can make stories out of my heartbreak, beauty out of sorrow.”</p><br>
<p>“I don’t care about anyone, and the feeling is quite obviously mutual.”</p><br>
<p>“What is my life for and what am I going to do with it? I don't know and I'm afraid. I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want.”</p><br>
<p>“How can you be so many women to so many strange people, oh you strange girl?”</p><br>
<p>“I know pretty much what I like and dislike; but please, don't ask me who I am.”</p><br>
<p>“My mother said the cure for thinking too much about yourself was helping somebody who was worse off than you.”</p><br>
<p>“The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.”</p><br>
<p>“Everything people did seemed so silly, because they only died in the end.”</p><br>
<p>“I am jealous of those who think more deeply, who write better, who draw better, who ski better, who look better, who live better, who love better than I.”</p><br>
<p>“I wondered why I couldn't go the whole way doing what I should any more. This made me sad and tired. Then I wondered why I couldn't go the whole way doing what I shouldn't, the way Doreen did, and this made me even sadder and more tired.”</p><br>
<p>“I have never found anybody who could stand to accept the daily demonstrative love I feel in me, and give back as good as I give.”</p><br>
<p>“I want so obviously, so desperately to be loved, and to be capable of love.”</p><br>
<p>“It was comforting to know I had fallen and could fall no farther.”</p><br>
<p>“Very few people do this any more. It's too risky. First of all, it's a hell of a responsibility to be yourself. It's much easier to be somebody else or nobody at all.”</p><br>
<p>“So many people are shut up tight inside themselves like boxes, yet they would open up, unfolding quite wonderfully, if only you were interested in them.”</p><br>
<p>“I wonder why I don't go to bed and go to sleep. But then it would be tomorrow, so I decide that no matter how tired, no matter how incoherent I am, I can skip on hour more of sleep and live.”</p><br>
<p>“I started adding up all the things I couldn't do.”</p><br>
<p>“I think writers are the most narcissistic people. Well, I musn't say this, I like many of them, a great many of my friends are writers.”</p><br>
<p>“I had been alone more than I could have been had I gone by myself.”</p><br>
<p>“Go out and do something. It isn’t your room that’s a prison, it’s yourself.”</p><br>
<p>“When they asked me what I wanted to be I said I didn't know.”</p><br>
<p>“What I fear most, I think, is the death of the imagination.”</p><br>
<p>“I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old.”</p><br>
<p>“I want to be able to sleep in an open field, to travel west, to walk freely at night...”</p><br>
<p>“Good to know that if I ever need attention all I have to do is die.”</p><br>
<p>“I felt dreadfully inadequate. The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn’t thought about it.”</p><br>
<p>“I wish you’d find the exit out of my head.”</p><br>
<p>“What a man wants is a mate and what a woman wants is infinite security.”</p><br>
<p>“I wonder about all the roads not taken and am moved to quote Frost...but won't. It is sad to be able only to mouth other poets. I want someone to mouth me.”</p><br>
<p>“I buried my head under the darkness of the pillow and pretended it was night. I couldn't see the point of getting up. I had nothing to look forward to.”</p><br>
<p>“How we need another soul to cling to, another body to keep us warm. To rest and trust; to give your soul in confidence: I need this, I need someone to pour myself into.”</p><br>
<p>“I want to be important. By being different. And these girls are all the same.”</p><br>
<p>“And the danger is that in this move toward new horizons and far directions, that I may lose what I have now, and not find anything except loneliness.”</p><br>
<p>“Some things are hard to write about. After something happens to you, you go to write it down, and either you over dramatize it, or underplay it, exaggerate the wrong parts or ignore the important ones. At any rate, you never write it quite the way you want to.”</p><br>
<p>“What horrifies me most is the idea of being useless: well-educated, brilliantly promising, and fading out into an indifferent middle age.”</p><br>
<p>"Even the sun-bearers feel cold sometimes."</p><br>
<p>“I wanted to be where nobody I knew could ever come.”</p><br>
<p>“There must be quite a few things that a hot bath won't cure, but I don't know many of them.”</p><br>
<p>"I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery—air, mountains, trees, people."</p><br>
<p>“Yes, I was infatuated with you: I am still. No one has ever heightened such a keen capacity of physical sensation in me. I cut you out because I couldn't stand being a passing fancy. Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams. And you weren't having any of those.”</p><br>
<p>"I want to taste and glory in each day, and never be afraid to experience pain."</p>

<p>"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life — think of it, dream of it, live on that idea."</p><br>
<p>"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached."</p><br>
<p>"You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself."</p><br>
<p>"Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and in every living being."</p><br>
<p>"In one word, this ideal is that you are divine."</p><br>
<p>"If faith in ourselves had been more extensively taught and practiced, I am sure a very large portion of the evils and miseries that we have would have vanished."</p><br>
<p>"Learn everything that is good from others, but bring it in, and in your own way absorb it; do not become others."</p><br>
<p>"The Vedanta recognises no sin it only recognises error. And the greatest error is to say that you are weak, that you are a sinner, a miserable creature."</p><br>
<p>"The more we come out and do good to others, the more our hearts will be purified, and God will be in them."</p><br>
<p>"Our duty is to encourage every one in his struggle to live up to his own highest idea, and strive at the same time to make the ideal as near as possible to the Truth."</p><br>
<p>"The whole secret of existence is to have no fear. Never fear what will become of you, depend on no one."</p><br>
<p>"The world is the great gymnasium where we come to make ourselves strong."</p><br>
<p>"Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It is the greatest heresy to think so."</p><br>
<p>"Stand up, be bold, be strong. Take the whole responsibility on your own shoulders, and know that you are the creator of your own destiny."</p><br>
<p>"External nature is only internal nature writ large."</p><br>
<p>“Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.”</p><br>
<p>"Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true."</p><br>
<p>"We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think."</p><br>
<p>"The greatest religion is to be true to your own nature. Have faith in yourselves."</p><br>
<p>"Be not afraid of anything. You will do marvelous work. It is fearlessness that brings heaven even in a moment."</p><br>
<p>"Women must be put in a position to solve their own problems in their own way."</p><br>
<p>"Do not wait for anybody or anything. Do whatever you can. Build your hope on none."<p><br>
<p>"Let men and women of all ages and all countries know that the blood of renunciation alone, not the blood of heroes, is the blood of religion."</p><br>
<p>"Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man."</p><br>
<p>"You are the creator of your own destiny."</p><br>
<p>“The only religion that ought to be taught is the religion of fearlessness. Either in this world or in the world of religion, it is true that fear is the sure cause of degradation and sin. It is fear that brings misery, fear that brings death, fear that breeds evil. And what causes fear? Ignorance of our own nature.”</p><br>
<p>"Take up an idea, devote yourself to it, struggle in patience, and the sun will rise."</p><br>
<p>"We are responsible for what we are, and whatever we wish ourselves to be, we have the power to make ourselves."</p><br>
<p>"Nothing is impossible to the person who has faith."</p><br>
<p>"Each work has got to pass through these stages — ridicule, opposition and then acceptance. Those who think ahead of their time are sure to be misunderstood.</p><br>
<p>"All love is expansion, all selfishness is contraction. Love is therefore the only law of life."</p><br>
<p>"Do you love your country? Then come, let us struggle for the higher and better things; look not back."</p><br>
<p>"Here in India it is religion that forms the very core of the national heart. It is the backbone, the bed‑rock, the foundation upon which the national edifice has been built."</p><br>
<p>"When an idea exclusively occupies the mind, it is transformed into an actual physical or mental state."</p><br>

<p>"If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced."</p><br>
<p>"I put my heart and my soul into my work, and have lost my mind in the process."</p><br>
<p>"The way to know life is to love many things."</p><br>
<p>“Love is eternal -- the aspect may change, but not the essence. There is the same difference in a person before and after he is in love as there is in an unlighted lamp and one that is burning. The lamp was there and was a good lamp, but now it is shedding light too, and that is its real function. And love makes one calmer about many things, and that way, one is more fit for one's work.”</p><br>
<p>"I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people."</p><br>
<p>"I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day."</p><br>
<p>"I want to touch people with my art. I want them to say 'he feels deeply, he feels tenderly.'"</p><br>
<p>"One must work and dare if one really wants to live."</p><br>
<p>“At present I absolutely want to paint a starry sky. It often seems to me that night is still more richly coloured than the day; having hues of the most intense violets, blues and greens. If only you pay attention to it you will see that certain stars are lemon-yellow, others pink or a green, blue and forget-me-not brilliance. And without my expatiating on this theme it is obvious that putting little white dots on the blue-black is not enough to paint a starry sky.”</p><br>
<p>"I sometimes think that the best way to know God is to love many things."</p><br>
<p>"For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream."</p><br>
<p>"What is done in love is done well."</p><br>
<p>“Your profession is not what brings home your weekly paycheck, your profession is what you're put here on earth to do, with such passion and such intensity that it becomes spiritual in calling.”</p>
<p>"I am always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it."</p><br>
<p>"The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore."</p><br>
<p>"A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke."</p><br>
<p>"I am not an adventurer by choice but by fate."</p><br>
<p>"I often think that people should live the life they have not planned for, in order to find what they truly are."</p><br>
<p>"I would rather die of passion than of boredom."</p><br>
<p>“It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done.”</p><br>

<p>"Some people go to priests; others to poetry; I to my friends."</p><br>

<p>"Yet it is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top."</p><br>
<p>"To enjoy freedom we have to control ourselves."</p><br>
<p>"The older one grows, the more one likes indecency."</p><br>
<p>“Second hand books are wild books, homeless books; they have come together in vast flocks of variegated feather, and have a charm which the domesticated volumes of the library lack.”</p><br>
<p>"Language is wine upon the lips."</p><br>
<p>"Arrange whatever pieces come your way."</p><br>
<p>"Books are the mirrors of the soul."</p><br>
<p>“A woman knows very well that, though a wit sends her his poems, praises her judgment, solicits her criticism, and drinks her tea, this by no means signifies that he respects her opinions, admires her understanding, or will refuse, though the rapier is denied him, to run through the body with his pen.”</p><br>
<p>"The past only comes back when the present runs so smoothly that it is like the sliding surface of a stream."</p><br>
<p>"It is impossible to go through life without trust."</p><br>
<p>"A mind that is stretched by a new idea never returns to its original dimensions."</p><br>

<p>"I am rooted, but I flow."</p><br>
<p>“How much better is silence; the coffee cup, the table. How much better to sit by myself like the solitary sea-bird that opens its wings on the stake. Let me sit here for ever with bare things, this coffee cup, this knife, this fork, things in themselves, myself being myself.”</p><br>
<p>"Each had his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by his heart, and his friends can only read the title."</p><br>
<p>"Be truthful, and the result is bound to be amazingly interesting."</p><br>
<p>"For beyond the difficulty of communicating oneself, there is the supreme difficulty of being oneself."</p><br>
<p>"It is our business to puncture gas‑bags and discover the seeds of truth."</p><br>
<p>"The history of men’s opposition to women’s emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself."</p><br>
<p>"I have a deeply hidden and inarticulate desire for something beyond the daily life."</p><br>
<p>"Growing up is losing some illusions, in order to acquire others."</p><br>
<p>“What is the meaning of life? That was all- a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years, the great revelation had never come. The great revelation perhaps never did come. Instead, there were little daily miracles, illuminations, matches struck unexpectedly in the dark; here was one.”</p><br>
