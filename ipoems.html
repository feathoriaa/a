  <h2 class="title">Stream Of Life</h2>
  <p class="author">by Rabindranath Tagore</p>

  <p>The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day<br>
  runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.</p>

  <p>It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth<br>
  in numberless blades of grass<br>
  and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.</p>

  <p>It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth<br>
  and of death, in ebb and in flow.</p>

  <p>I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life.<br>
  And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Yesterday And Today XII</h2>
  <p class="author">by Kahlil Gibran</p>

  <p>The gold-hoarder walked in his palace park and with him walked his troubles.<br>
  And over his head hovered worries as a vulture hovers over a carcass, until he reached a beautiful lake surrounded by magnificent marble statuary.</p>

  <p>He sat there pondering the water which poured from the mouths of the statues like thoughts flowing freely from a lover's imagination, and contemplating heavily his palace which stood upon a knoll like a birth-mark upon the cheek of a maiden.<br>
  His fancy revealed to him the pages of his life's drama which he read with falling tears that veiled his eyes and prevented him from viewing man's feeble additions to Nature.</p>

  <p>He looked back with piercing regret to the images of his early life, woven into pattern by the gods, until he could no longer control his anguish.<br>
  He said aloud, 'Yesterday I was grazing my sheep in the green valley, enjoying my existence, sounding my flute, and holding my head high. Today I am a prisoner of greed. Gold leads into gold, then into restlessness and finally into crushing misery.'</p>

  <p>'Yesterday I was like a singing bird, soaring freely here and there in the fields.<br>
  Today I am a slave to fickle wealth, society's rules, and city's customs, and purchased friends, pleasing the people by conforming to the strange and narrow laws of man.<br>
  I was born to be free and enjoy the bounty of life, but I find myself like a beast of burden so heavily laden with gold that his back is breaking.'</p>

  <p>'Where are the spacious plains, the singing brooks, the pure breeze, the closeness of Nature?<br>
  Where is my deity? I have lost all! Naught remains save loneliness that saddens me, gold that ridicules me, slaves who curse to my back, and a palace that I have erected as a tomb for my happiness, and in whose greatness I have lost my heart.'</p>

  <p>'Yesterday I roamed the prairies and the hills together with the Bedouin's daughter; Virtue was our companion, Love our delight, and the moon our guardian.<br>
  Today I am among women with shallow beauty who sell themselves for gold and diamonds.'</p>

  <p>'Yesterday I was carefree, sharing with the shepherds all the joy of life; eating, playing, working, singing, and dancing together to the music of the heart's truth.<br>
  Today I find myself among the people like a frightened lamb among the wolves.<br>
  As I walk in the roads, they gaze at me with hateful eyes and point at me with scorn and jealousy, and as I steal through the park I see frowning faces all about me.'</p>

  <p>'Yesterday I was rich in happiness and today I am poor in gold.'</p>

  <p>'Yesterday I was a happy shepherd looking upon his head as a merciful king looks with pleasure upon his contented subjects.<br>
  Today I am a slave standing before my wealth, my wealth which robbed me of the beauty of life I once knew.'</p>

  <p>'Forgive me, my Judge! I did not know that riches would put my life in fragments and lead me into the dungeons of harshness and stupidity.<br>
  What I thought was glory is naught but an eternal inferno.'</p>

  <p>He gathered himself wearily and walked slowly toward the palace, sighing and repeating, 'Is this what people call wealth?<br>
  Is this the god I am serving and worshipping?<br>
  Is this what I seek of the earth?<br>
  Why can I not trade it for one particle of contentment?<br>
  Who would sell me one beautiful thought for a ton of gold?<br>
  Who would give me one moment of love for a handful of gems?<br>
  Who would grant me an eye that can see others' hearts, and take all my coffers in barter?'</p>

  <p>As he reached the palace gates he turned and looked toward the city as Jeremiah gazed toward Jerusalem.<br>
  He raised his arms in woeful lament and shouted, 'Oh people of the noisome city, who are living in darkness, hastening toward misery, preaching falsehood, and speaking with stupidity...until when shall you remain ignorant?<br>
  Until when shall you abide in the filth of life and continue to desert its gardens?<br>
  Why wear you tattered robes of narrowness while the silk raiment of Nature's beauty is fashioned for you?<br>
  The lamp of wisdom is dimming; it is time to furnish it with oil.<br>
  The house of true fortune is being destroyed; it is time to rebuild it and guard it.<br>
  The thieves of ignorance have stolen the treasure of your peace; it is time to retake it!'</p>

  <p>At that moment a poor man stood before him and stretched forth his hand for alms.<br>
  As he looked at the beggar, his lips parted, his eyes brightened with a softness, and his face radiated kindness.<br>
  It was as if the yesterday he had lamented by the lake had come to greet him.<br>
  He embraced the pauper with affection and filled his hands with gold, and with a voice sincere with the sweetness of love he said, 'Come back tomorrow and bring with you your fellow sufferers. All your possessions will be restored.'</p>

  <p>He entered his palace saying, 'Everything in life is good; even gold, for it teaches a lesson.<br>
  Money is like a stringed instrument; he who does not know how to use it properly will hear only discordant music.<br>
  Money is like love; it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and it enlivens the other who turns it upon his fellow man.'</p>

  <h2 class="title">O Me! O Life!</h2>
  <p class="author">By Walt Whitman</p>

  <p>Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,<br>
  Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,<br>
  Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)<br>
  Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,<br>
  Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,<br>
  Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,<br>
  The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?</p>

  <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">Answer.</p>

  <p>That you are here—that life exists and identity,<br>
  That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Desiderata – Words for Life</h2>
  <p class="author">By Max Ehrmann</p>

  <p>Go placidly amid the noise and haste,<br>
  and remember what peace there may be in silence.<br>
  As far as possible without surrender<br>
  be on good terms with all persons.<br>
  Speak your truth quietly and clearly;<br>
  and listen to others,<br>
  even the dull and the ignorant;<br>
  they too have their story.</p>

  <p>Avoid loud and aggressive persons,<br>
  they are vexations to the spirit.<br>
  If you compare yourself with others,<br>
  you may become vain and bitter;<br>
  for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br>
  Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</p>

  <p>Keep interested in your own career, however humble;<br>
  it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br>
  Exercise caution in your business affairs;<br>
  for the world is full of trickery.<br>
  But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;<br>
  many persons strive for high ideals;<br>
  and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>

  <p>Be yourself.<br>
  Especially, do not feign affection.<br>
  Neither be cynical about love;<br>
  for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment<br>
  it is as perennial as the grass.</p>

  <p>Take kindly the counsel of the years,<br>
  gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br>
  Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br>
  But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.<br>
  Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br>
  Beyond a wholesome discipline,<br>
  be gentle with yourself.</p>

  <p>You are a child of the universe,<br>
  no less than the trees and the stars;<br>
  you have a right to be here.<br>
  And whether or not it is clear to you,<br>
  no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</p>

  <p>Therefore be at peace with God,<br>
  whatever you conceive Him to be,<br>
  and whatever your labors and aspirations,<br>
  in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.</p>

  <p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,<br>
  it is still a beautiful world.<br>
  Be cheerful.<br>
  Strive to be happy.</p>

  <h2 class="title">A Psalm of Life</h2>
  <p class="author">By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>
  <p class="subtitle">What The Heart Of The Young Man Said To The Psalmist</p>

  <p>Tell me not, in mournful numbers,<br>
     Life is but an empty dream!<br>
  For the soul is dead that slumbers,<br>
     And things are not what they seem.</p>

  <p>Life is real! Life is earnest!<br>
     And the grave is not its goal;<br>
  Dust thou art, to dust returnest,<br>
     Was not spoken of the soul.</p>

  <p>Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,<br>
     Is our destined end or way;<br>
  But to act, that each to-morrow<br>
     Find us farther than to-day.</p>

  <p>Art is long, and Time is fleeting,<br>
     And our hearts, though stout and brave,<br>
  Still, like muffled drums, are beating<br>
     Funeral marches to the grave.</p>

  <p>In the world’s broad field of battle,<br>
     In the bivouac of Life,<br>
  Be not like dumb, driven cattle!<br>
     Be a hero in the strife!</p>

  <p>Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!<br>
     Let the dead Past bury its dead!<br>
  Act,— act in the living Present!<br>
     Heart within, and God o’erhead!</p>

  <p>Lives of great men all remind us<br>
     We can make our lives sublime,<br>
  And, departing, leave behind us<br>
     Footprints on the sands of time;</p>

  <p>Footprints, that perhaps another,<br>
     Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,<br>
  A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,<br>
     Seeing, shall take heart again.</p>

  <p>Let us, then, be up and doing,<br>
     With a heart for any fate;<br>
  Still achieving, still pursuing,<br>
     Learn to labor and to wait.</p>

  <h2 class="title">“Life”</h2>
  <p class="author">By Charlotte Brontë</p>

  <p>LIFE, believe, is not a dream<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;So dark as sages say;<br>
  Oft a little morning rain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Foretells a pleasant day.<br>
  Sometimes there are clouds of gloom,<br>
  But these are transient all;<br>
  If the shower will make the roses bloom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;O why lament its fall ?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapidly, merrily,<br>
  Life's sunny hours flit by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Gratefully, cheerily,<br>
  Enjoy them as they fly !</p>

  <p>What though Death at times steps in<br>
  And calls our Best away ?<br>
  What though sorrow seems to win,<br>
  O'er hope, a heavy sway ?<br>
  Yet hope again elastic springs,<br>
  Unconquered, though she fell;<br>
  Still buoyant are her golden wings,<br>
  Still strong to bear us well.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfully, fearlessly,<br>
  The day of trial bear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;For gloriously, victoriously,<br>
  Can courage quell despair !</p>

  <h2 class="title">“Life Doesn’t Frighten Me”</h2>
  <p class="author">By Maya Angelou</p>

  <p>Shadows on the wall<br>
  Noises down the hall<br>
  Life doesn't frighten me at all</p>

  <p>Bad dogs barking loud<br>
  Big ghosts in a cloud<br>
  Life doesn't frighten me at all</p>

  <p>Mean old Mother Goose<br>
  Lions on the loose<br>
  They don't frighten me at all</p>

  <p>Dragons breathing flame<br>
  On my counterpane<br>
  That doesn't frighten me at all.</p>

  <p>I go boo<br>
  Make them shoo<br>
  I make fun<br>
  Way they run<br>
  I won't cry<br>
  So they fly<br>
  I just smile<br>
  They go wild</p>

  <p>Life doesn't frighten me at all.</p>

  <p>Tough guys fight<br>
  All alone at night<br>
  Life doesn't frighten me at all.</p>

  <p>Panthers in the park<br>
  Strangers in the dark<br>
  No, they don't frighten me at all.</p>

  <p>That new classroom where<br>
  Boys all pull my hair<br>
  (Kissy little girls<br>
  With their hair in curls)<br>
  They don't frighten me at all.</p>

  <p>Don't show me frogs and snakes<br>
  And listen for my scream,<br>
  If I'm afraid at all<br>
  It's only in my dreams.</p>

  <p>I've got a magic charm<br>
  That I keep up my sleeve<br>
  I can walk the ocean floor<br>
  And never have to breathe.</p>

  <p>Life doesn't frighten me at all<br>
  Not at all<br>
  Not at all.</p>

  <p>Life doesn't frighten me at all.</p>

  <h2 class="title">The Layers</h2>
  <p class="author">By Stanley Kunitz</p>

  <p>I have walked through many lives,<br>
  some of them my own,<br>
  and I am not who I was,<br>
  though some principle of being<br>
  abides, from which I struggle<br>
  not to stray.<br>
  When I look behind,<br>
  as I am compelled to look<br>
  before I can gather strength<br>
  to proceed on my journey,<br>
  I see the milestones dwindling<br>
  toward the horizon<br>
  and the slow fires trailing<br>
  from the abandoned camp-sites,<br>
  over which scavenger angels<br>
  wheel on heavy wings.</p>

  <p>Oh, I have made myself a tribe<br>
  out of my true affections,<br>
  and my tribe is scattered!<br>
  How shall the heart be reconciled<br>
  to its feast of losses?<br>
  In a rising wind<br>
  the manic dust of my friends,<br>
  those who fell along the way,<br>
  bitterly stings my face.</p>

  <p>Yet I turn, I turn,<br>
  exalting somewhat,<br>
  with my will intact to go<br>
  wherever I need to go,<br>
  and every stone on the road<br>
  precious to me.</p>

  <p>In my darkest night,<br>
  when the moon was covered<br>
  and I roamed through wreckage,<br>
  a nimbus-clouded voice<br>
  directed me:<br>
  “Live in the layers,<br>
  not on the litter.”</p>

  <p>Though I lack the art<br>
  to decipher it,<br>
  no doubt the next chapter<br>
  in my book of transformations<br>
  is already written.<br>
  I am not done with my changes.</p>

  Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
  Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>

  <p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
  If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</p>

  <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
  And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
  And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
  And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
  Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>

  <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
  If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
  If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
  Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>

  <h2 class="title">Still I Rise</h2>
  <p class="author">By Maya Angelou</p>

  <p>You may write me down in history<br>
  With your bitter, twisted lies,<br>
  You may trod me in the very dirt<br>
  But still, like dust, I'll rise.</p>

  <p>Does my sassiness upset you?<br>
  Why are you beset with gloom?<br>
  ’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br>
  Pumping in my living room.</p>

  <p>Just like moons and like suns,<br>
  With the certainty of tides,<br>
  Just like hopes springing high,<br>
  Still I'll rise.</p>

  <p>Did you want to see me broken?<br>
  Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br>
  Shoulders falling down like teardrops,<br>
  Weakened by my soulful cries?</p>

  <p>Does my haughtiness offend you?<br>
  Don't you take it awful hard<br>
  ’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br>
  Diggin’ in my own backyard.</p>

  <p>You may shoot me with your words,<br>
  You may cut me with your eyes,<br>
  You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br>
  But still, like air, I’ll rise.</p>

  <p>Does my sexiness upset you?<br>
  Does it come as a surprise<br>
  That I dance like I've got diamonds<br>
  At the meeting of my thighs?</p>

  <p>Out of the huts of history’s shame<br>
  I rise<br>
  Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br>
  I rise<br>
  I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br>
  Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.</p>

  <p>Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br>
  I rise<br>
  Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear<br>
  I rise<br>
  Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br>
  I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br>
  I rise<br>
  I rise<br>
  I rise.</p>

  <h2 class="title">The Will to Win</h2>
  <p class="author">By Berton Braley</p>

  <p>If you want a thing bad enough<br>
  To go out and fight for it,<br>
  Work day and night for it,<br>
  Give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it<br>
  If only desire of it<br>
  Makes you quite mad enough<br>
  Never to tire of it,<br>
  Makes you hold all other things tawdry and cheap for it</p>

  <p>If life seems all empty and useless without it<br>
  And all that you scheme and you dream is about it,<br>
  If gladly you'll sweat for it,<br>
  Fret for it,<br>
  Plan for it,<br>
  Lose all your terror of God or man for it,</p>

  <p>If you'll simply go after that thing that you want,<br>
  With all your capacity,<br>
  Strength and sagacity,<br>
  Faith, hope and confidence, stern pertinacity,<br>
  If neither cold poverty, famished and gaunt,<br>
  Nor sickness nor pain<br>
  Of body or brain<br>
  Can turn you away from the thing that you want,<br>
  If dogged and grim you besiege and beset it,<br>
  You'll get it!</p>

  <h2 class="title">The Road Not Taken</h2>
  <p class="author">By Robert Frost</p>

  <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
  And sorry I could not travel both<br>
  And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
  And looked down one as far as I could<br>
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

  <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
  And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
  Though as for that the passing there<br>
  Had worn them really about the same,</p>

  <p>And both that morning equally lay<br>
  In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
  I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

  <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
  I took the one less traveled by,<br>
  And that has made all the difference.</p>

  <p class="author">By Dylan Thomas</p>

  <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
  Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

  <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
  Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
  Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

  <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

  <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
  And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
  Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

  <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
  Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

  <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
  Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
  Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>

  <h2 class="title">Try Again</h2>
  <p class="author">By William Edward Hickson</p>

  <p>Try again! — Try again!<br>
  A failure is not a crime;<br>
  Though the pace be long, dogged and slow,<br>
  Along the road you climb;<br>
  If at first you don’t succeed,<br>
  Try, try, try again;<br>
  If at first you don’t succeed,<br>
  Try, try, try again.</p>

  <p>Once the goal is fairly sighted,<br>
  Though it seem beyond your reach,<br>
  You can find a path to it<br>
  If you never cease to teach<br>
  The heart and brain to patient toil,<br>
  The hand to brave endeavour;<br>
  If at first you don’t succeed,<br>
  Try, try, try again.</p>

  <p>If you’re tempted to be idle<br>
  When some task is hard to do,<br>
  If the right thing’s worth the doing,<br>
  Never be content with “Through.”<br>
  Persevere, and courage keep,<br>
  For hardships bring their gain;<br>
  If at first you don’t succeed,<br>
  Try, try, try again.</p>

  <p>Little strokes fell great oaks down;<br>
  Little rills will make the sea;<br>
  Forward, upward, onward ever—<br>
  This should be your constant plea.<br>
  Do not lose your hope and faith<br>
  When the skies are overcast;<br>
  If at first you don’t succeed,<br>
  Try, try, try again.</p>

  <p>Try again; there’s many a failure<br>
  Who by effort have prevailed;<br>
  History is full of triumphs<br>
  Won by those who never failed.<br>
  They were poor, obscure and brave,<br>
  But their purpose did remain;<br>

  <p class="author">By Terrance Hayes</p>

  <p>Living Single is on at 8<br>
  & I'm waiting with Ma<br>
  in line at the grocery store<br>
  as the snow falls outside<br>
  & people push & shove,<br>
  Black and Brown faces<br>
  mean-mugging each other<br>
  as they tussle for the last<br>
  loaf of white bread, the lone<br>
  gallon of milk in the refrigerator<br>
  as canned goods roll down<br>
  packed aisles & my young brother<br>
  wants to chase them, but Ma has<br>
  a tight grip on his hand as he squirms<br>
  in protest, I see through the store's windows<br>
  the lights at the McDonald's have turned off<br>
  as workers rush through the falling snow<br>
  towards the bus stop & I don't know<br>
  who I am & they don't know who I am<br>
  but a milk-chocolate brown-skinned girl<br>
  with large dark brown eyes, black curly<br>
  hair that never stays straight even after<br>
  the million-degree heat of the hot comb<br>
  Ma scorches through my scalp & I wish<br>
  I could go to the bathroom but I'd be lost<br>
  in this mass of heaving bodies, grabbing<br>
  bags of rice & boxes of spiral pasta & canned<br>
  corn as my brother breaks free from Ma's grip,<br>
  rushing towards a plastic ball rolling towards him,<br>
  & I chase after him. Get back here! Ma shouts<br>
  for us to come back as she has moved up<br>
  in the line. My brother laughs with glee as<br>
  he bounces the ball as if we're at Franklin Park,<br>
  playing in the large, green, open field as<br>
  a lion roars from its habitat, yearning to be free<br>
  from its cage, & I stop running, yearning to be free<br>
  of this store, its people, the noise & the smell<br>
  & go home to watch Living Single at 8 & not chase<br>
  after my lil brother like I'm his keeper.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Nothing Gold Can Stay</h2>
  <p class="author">By Robert Frost</p>

  <p>Nature's first green is gold,<br>
  Her hardest hue to hold.<br>
  Her early leaf's a flower;<br>
  But only so an hour.<br>
  Then leaf subsides to leaf,<br>
  So Eden sank to grief,<br>
  So dawn goes down to day<br>
  Nothing gold can stay.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Ode on a Grecian Urn</h2>
  <p class="author">By John Keats</p>

  <p>Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,<br>
       Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,<br>
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express<br>
       A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:<br>
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape<br>
       Of deities or mortals, or of both,<br>
               In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?<br>
       What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?<br>
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?<br>
               What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?</p>

  <p>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard<br>
       Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;<br>
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,<br>
       Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:<br>
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave<br>
       Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;<br>
               Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,<br>
Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;<br>
       She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,<br>
               For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!</p>

  <p>Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed<br>
         Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;<br>
And, happy melodist, unwearied,<br>
         For ever piping songs for ever new;<br>
More happy love! more happy, happy love!<br>
         For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,<br>
                For ever panting, and for ever young;<br>
All breathing human passion far above,<br>
         That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,<br>
                A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.</p>

  <p>Who are these coming to the sacrifice?<br>
         To what green altar, O mysterious priest,<br>
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,<br>
         And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?<br>
What little town by river or sea shore,<br>
         Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,<br>
                Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?<br>
And, little town, thy streets for evermore<br>
         Will silent be; and not a soul to tell<br>
                Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.</p>

  <p>O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede<br>
         Of marble men and maidens overwrought,<br>
With forest branches and the trodden weed;<br>
         Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought<br>
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!<br>
         When old age shall this generation waste,<br>
                Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe<br>
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,<br>
         "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all<br>
                Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."</p>

  A Soul inslav'd so many wayes?<br>
  With bolts of Bones, that fetter'd stands<br>
  In Feet; and manacled in Hands.<br>
  Here blinded with an Eye; and there<br>
  Deaf with the drumming of an Ear.<br>
  A Soul hung up, as 'twere, in Chains<br>
  Of Nerves, and Arteries, and Veins.<br>
  Tortur'd, besides each other part,<br>
  In a vain Head, and double Heart.</p>

  <h3>Body</h3>
  <p>O who shall me deliver whole,<br>
  From bonds of this Tyrannic Soul?<br>
  Which, stretcht upright, impales me so,<br>
  That mine own Precipice I go;<br>
  And warms and moves this needless Frame:<br>
  (A Fever could but do the same.)<br>
  And, wanting where its spight to try,<br>
  Has made me live to let me dye.<br>
  A Body that could never rest,<br>
  Since this ill Spirit it possest.</p>

  <h3>Soul</h3>
  <p>What Magic could me thus confine<br>
  Within another's Grief to pine?<br>
  Where whatsoever it complain,<br>
  I feel, that cannot feel, the pain.<br>
  And all my Care itself employes,<br>
  That to preserve, which me destroys:<br>
  Constrain'd not only to indure<br>
  Diseases, but, what's worse, the Cure:<br>
  And ready oft the Port to gain,<br>
  Am Shipwrackt into Health again.</p>

  <h3>Body</h3>
  <p>But Physick yet could never reach<br>
  The Maladies Thou me dost teach;<br>
  Whom first the Cramp of Hope does tear,<br>
  And then the Palsie Shakes of Fear.<br>
  The Pestilence of Love does heat:<br>
  Or Hatred's hidden Ulcer eat.<br>
  Joy's chearful Madness does perplex:<br>
  Or Sorrow's other Madness vex.<br>
  Which Knowledge forces me to know;<br>
  And Memory will not forego.<br>
  What but a Soul could have the wit<br>
  To build me up for Sin so fit?<br>
  So Architects do square and hew,<br>
  Green Trees that in the Forest grew.</p>

  <p>When I consider how my light is spent,<br>
  Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,<br>

  My true account, lest He returning chide,<br>

  full of adventure, full of discovery.<br>
  Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
  angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:<br>
  you’ll never find things like that on your way<br>
  as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,<br>
  as long as a rare excitement<br>

  Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
  wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them<br>
  unless you bring them along inside your soul,<br>
  unless your soul sets them up in front of you.</p>

  <p>Hope your road is a long one.<br>
  May there be many summer mornings when,<br>
  with what pleasure, what joy,<br>
  you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;<br>
  may you stop at Phoenician trading stations<br>
  to buy fine things,<br>
  mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br>
  sensual perfume of every kind—<br>
  as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br>
  and may you visit many Egyptian cities<br>
  to learn and go on learning from their scholars.</p>

  <p>Keep Ithaka always in your mind.<br>
  Arriving there is what you’re destined for.<br>
  But don’t hurry the journey at all.<br>
  Better if it lasts for years,<br>
  so you’re old by the time you reach the island,<br>
  wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,<br>
  not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.</p>

  <p>Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.<br>
  Without her you wouldn't have set out.<br>
  She has nothing left to give you now.</p>

  <p>And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.<br>
  Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,<br>
  you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.</p>

  <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>

  <h2 class="title">She Walks in Beauty</h2>
  <p class="author">By Lord Byron (George Gordon)</p>

  <p>She walks in beauty, like the night<br>
  Of cloudless climes and starry skies;<br>
  And all that’s best of dark and bright<br>
  Meet in her aspect and her eyes;<br>
  Thus mellowed to that tender light<br>
  Which heaven to gaudy day denies.</p>

  <p>One shade the more, one ray the less,<br>
  Had half impaired the nameless grace<br>
  Which waves in every raven tress,<br>
  Or softly lightens o’er her face;<br>
  Where thoughts serenely sweet express,<br>
  How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.</p>

  <p>And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,<br>
  So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,<br>
  The smiles that win, the tints that glow,<br>
  But tell of days in goodness spent,<br>
  A mind at peace with all below,<br>
  A heart whose love is innocent!</p>

  <h2 class="title">When You Are Old</h2>
  <p class="author">By William Butler Yeats</p>

  <p>When you are old and grey and full of sleep,<br>
  And nodding by the fire, take down this book,<br>
  And slowly read, and dream of the soft look<br>
  Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;</p>

  <p>How many loved your moments of glad grace,<br>
  And loved your beauty with love false or true,<br>
  But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,<br>
  And loved the sorrows of your changing face;</p>

  <p>And bending down beside the glowing bars,<br>
  Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled<br>
  And paced upon the mountains overhead<br>
  And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</p>

  <p>The time will come<br>
     when, with elation<br>
  you will greet yourself arriving<br>
     at your own door, in your own mirror<br>
  and each will smile at the other's welcome,</p>

  <p>and say, sit here. Eat.<br>
  You will love again the stranger who was your self.<br>
  Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart<br>
  to itself, to the stranger who has loved you</p>

  <p>all your life, whom you ignored<br>
  for another, who knows you by heart.<br>
  Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,</p>

  <p>the photographs, the desperate notes,<br>
  peel your own image from the mirror.<br>
  Sit. Feast on your life.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Annabel Lee</h2>
  <p class="author">By Edgar Allan Poe</p>

  <p>It was many and many a year ago,<br>
     In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
  That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
     By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
  And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
     Than to love and be loved by me.</p>

  <p>I was a child and she was a child,<br>
     In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
  But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
     I and my Annabel Lee—<br>
  With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
     Coveted her and me.</p>

  <p>And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
     In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
     My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
  So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
     And bore her away from me,<br>
  To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
     In this kingdom by the sea.</p>

  <p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
     Went envying her and me—<br>
  Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
     In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
  That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
     Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>

  <p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
     Of those who were older than we—<br>
     Of many far wiser than we—<br>
  And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
     Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</p>

  <p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
  And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
     Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
     Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
     In her sepulchre there by the sea—<br>
     In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>

  <p>“Hope” is the thing with feathers -<br>
  That perches in the soul -<br>
  And sings the tune without the words -<br>
  And never stops - at all -</p>

  <p>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br>
  And sore must be the storm -<br>
  That could abash the little Bird<br>
  That kept so many warm -</p>

  And on the strangest Sea -<br>
  Yet - never - in Extremity,<br>

  You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>

  Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.<br>
  Meanwhile the world goes on.<br>
  Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain<br>

  <h2 class="title">A Brave and Startling Truth</h2>
  <p class="author">By Maya Angelou</p>

  <p>We, this people, on a small and lonely planet<br>
     Traveling through casual space<br>
     Past aloof stars, across the way of indifferent suns<br>
     To a destination where all signs tell us<br>
     It is possible and imperative that we learn<br>
     A brave and startling truth</p>

  <p>And when we come to it<br>
     To the day of peacemaking<br>
     When we release our fingers<br>
     From fists of hostility<br>
     And allow the pure air to cool our palms</p>

  <p>When we come to it<br>
     When the curtain falls on the minstrel show of hate<br>
     And faces sooted with scorn are scrubbed clean<br>
     When battlefields and coliseum<br>
     No longer rake our unique and particular sons and daughters<br>
     Up with the bruised and bloody grass<br>
     To lie in identical plots in foreign soil</p>

  <p>When the rapacious storming of the churches<br>
     The screaming racket in the temples have ceased<br>
     When the pennants are waving gaily<br>
     When the banners of the world tremble<br>
     Stoutly in the good, clean breeze</p>

  <p>When we come to it<br>
     When we let the rifles fall from our shoulders<br>
     And children dress their dolls in flags of truce<br>
     When land mines of death have been removed<br>
     And the aged can walk into evenings of peace<br>
     When religious ritual is not perfumed<br>
     By the incense of burning flesh<br>
     And childhood dreams are not kicked awake<br>
     By nightmares of abuse</p>

  <p>When we come to it<br>
     Then we will confess that not the Pyramids<br>
     With their stones set in mysterious perfection<br>
     Nor the Gardens of Babylon<br>
     Hanging as eternal beauty<br>
     In our collective memory<br>
     Not the Grand Canyon<br>
     Kindled into delicious color<br>
     By Western sunsets</p>

  <p>Nor the Danube, flowing its blue soul into Europe<br>
     Not the sacred peak of Mount Fuji<br>
     Stretching to the Rising Sun<br>
     Neither Father Amazon nor Mother Mississippi who, without favor,<br>
     Nurture all creatures in the depths and on the shores<br>
     These are not the only wonders of the world</p>

  <p>When we come to it<br>
     We, this people, on this minuscule and kithless globe<br>
     Who reach daily for the bomb, the blade and the dagger<br>
     Yet who petition in the dark for tokens of peace<br>
     We, this people on this mote of matter<br>
     In whose mouths abide cankerous words<br>
     Which challenge our very existence<br>
     Yet out of those same mouths<br>
     Come songs of such exquisite sweetness<br>
     That the heart falters in its labor<br>
     And the body is quieted into awe</p>

  <p>We, this people, on this small and drifting planet<br>
     Whose hands can strike with such abandon<br>
     That in a twinkling, life is sapped from the living<br>
     Yet those same hands can touch with such healing, irresistible tenderness<br>
     That the haughty neck is happy to bow<br>
     And the proud back is glad to bend<br>
     Out of such chaos, of such contradiction<br>
     We learn that we are neither devils nor divines</p>

  <p>When we come to it<br>
     We, this people, on this wayward, floating body<br>
     Created on this earth, of this earth<br>
     Have the power to fashion for this earth<br>
     A climate where every man and every woman<br>
     Can live freely without sanctimonious piety<br>
     Without crippling fear</p>

  <p>When we come to it<br>
     We must confess that we are the possible<br>
     We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world<br>
     That is when, and only when<br>
     We come to it.</p>

  <p>In out-of-the-way places of the heart,<br>
     Where your thoughts never think to wander,<br>
     This beginning has been quietly forming,<br>
     Waiting until you were ready to emerge.</p>

  <p>For a long time it has watched your desire,<br>
     Feeling the emptiness growing inside you,<br>
     Noticing how you willed yourself on,<br>
     Still unable to leave what you had outgrown.</p>

  <p>It watched you play with the seduction of safety<br>
     And the gray promises that sameness whispered,<br>
     Heard the waves of turmoil rise and relent,<br>
     Wondered would you always live like this.</p>

  <p>Then the delight, when your courage kindled,<br>
     And out you stepped onto new ground,<br>
     Your eyes young again with energy and dream,<br>
     A path of plenitude opening before you.</p>

  <p>Though your destination is not yet clear<br>
     You can trust the promise of this opening;<br>
     Unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning<br>
     That is at one with your life's desire.</p>

  <p>Awaken your spirit to adventure;<br>
     Hold nothing back, learn to find ease in risk;<br>
     Soon you will be home in a new rhythm,<br>
     For your soul senses the world that awaits you.</p>

  <p>Take this kiss upon the brow!<br>
     And, in parting from you now,<br>

     In a night, or in a day,<br>
     In a vision, or in none,<br>
     Is it therefore the less gone? <br>
     All that we see or seem<br>
     Is but a dream within a dream.</p>

  <p>I stand amid the roar<br>
     Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
     And I hold within my hand<br>
     Grains of the golden sand —<br>
     How few! yet how they creep<br>
     Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
     While I weep — while I weep!<br>
     O God! Can I not grasp<br>
     Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
     O God! can I not save<br>
     One from the pitiless wave?<br>
     Is all that we see or seem<br>

  <h2 class="title">Happiness</h2>
  <p class="author">By Jane Kenyon</p>

  <p>There’s just no accounting for happiness,<br>
     or the way it turns up like a prodigal<br>
     who comes back to the dust at your feet<br>
     having squandered a fortune far away.</p>

  <p>And how can you not forgive?<br>
     You make a feast in honor of what<br>
     was lost, and take from its place the finest<br>
     garment, which you saved for an occasion<br>
     you could not imagine, and you weep night and day<br>
     to know that you were not abandoned,<br>
     that happiness saved its most extreme form<br>
     for you alone.</p>

  <p>No, happiness is the uncle you never<br>
     knew about, who flies a single-engine plane<br>
     onto the grassy landing strip, hitchhikes<br>
     into town, and inquires at every door<br>
     until he finds you asleep midafternoon<br>
     as you so often are during the unmerciful<br>
     hours of your despair.</p>

  <p>It comes to the monk in his cell.<br>
     It comes to the woman sweeping the street<br>
     with a birch broom, to the child<br>
     whose mother has passed out from drink.<br>
     It comes to the lover, to the dog chewing<br>
     a sock, to the pusher, to the basketmaker,<br>
     and to the clerk stacking cans of carrots<br>
     in the night.<br>
     It even comes to the boulder<br>
     in the perpetual shade of pine barrens,<br>
     to rain falling on the open sea,<br>
     to the wineglass, weary of holding wine.</p>

  <p>It little profits that an idle king,<br>
     By this still hearth, among these barren crags,<br>
     Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole<br>
     Unequal laws unto a savage race,<br>
     That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.<br>
     I cannot rest from travel: I will drink<br>
     Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd<br>
     Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those<br>
     That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when<br>
     Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades<br>
     Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;<br>
     For always roaming with a hungry heart<br>
     Much have I seen and known; cities of men<br>
     And manners, climates, councils, governments,<br>
     Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;<br>
     And drunk delight of battle with my peers,<br>
     Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.<br>
     I am a part of all that I have met;<br>
     Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'<br>

     For ever and forever when I move.<br>
     How dull it is to pause, to make an end,<br>
     To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!<br>
     As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life<br>
     Were all too little, and of one to me<br>
     Little remains: but every hour is saved<br>
     From that eternal silence, something more,<br>
     A bringer of new things; and vile it were<br>
     For some three suns to store and hoard myself,<br>
     And this gray spirit yearning in desire<br>
     To follow knowledge like a sinking star,<br>
     Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.</p>

  <p>This is my son, mine own Telemachus,<br>
     To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,—<br>
     Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil<br>
     This labour, by slow prudence to make mild<br>
     A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees<br>
     Subdue them to the useful and the good.<br>
     Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere<br>
     Of common duties, decent not to fail<br>
     In offices of tenderness, and pay<br>
     Meet adoration to my household gods,<br>
     When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.</p>

  <p>There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:<br>
     There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,<br>
     Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me—<br>
     That ever with a frolic welcome took<br>
     The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed<br>
     Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;<br>
     Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;<br>
     Death closes all: but something ere the end,<br>
     Some work of noble note, may yet be done,<br>
     Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.<br>
     The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:<br>
     The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep<br>
     Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,<br>
     'T is not too late to seek a newer world.<br>
     Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br>
     The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br>
     To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br>
     Of all the western stars, until I die.<br>
     It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br>
     It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>
     And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br>
     Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'<br>
     We are not now that strength which in old days<br>
     Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;<br>
     One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br>
     Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>
     To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>

     Each changing place with that which goes before,<br>
     In sequent toil all forwards do contend.<br>
     Nativity, once in the main of light,<br>
     Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,<br>
     Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,<br>
     And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.<br>
     Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth<br>
     And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,<br>
     Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,<br>
     And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:<br>
     And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,<br>
     Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Holy Sonnets: Death, be not proud</h2>
  <p class="author">By John Donne</p>

  <p>Death, be not proud, though some have called thee<br>
     Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;<br>
     For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow<br>
     Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.<br>
     From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,<br>
     Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,<br>
     And soonest our best men with thee do go,<br>
     Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.<br>
     Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,<br>
     And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,<br>
     And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well<br>
     And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?<br>
     One short sleep past, we wake eternally<br>
     And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Auguries of Innocence</h2>
  <p class="author">By William Blake</p>

  <p>To see a world in a grain of sand<br>
  And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>
  Hold infinity in the palm of your hand<br>
  And eternity in an hour.</p>

  <p>A robin redbreast in a cage<br>
  Puts all Heaven in a rage.<br>
  A dove house fill'd with doves and pigeons<br>
  Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.<br>
  A dog starv'd at his master's gate<br>
  Predicts the ruin of the state.<br>
  A horse misus'd upon the road<br>
  Calls to Heaven for human blood.<br>
  Each outcry of the hunted hare<br>
  A fibre from the brain does tear.<br>
  A skylark wounded in the wing,<br>
  A Cherubim does cease to sing.<br>
  The game cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight<br>
  Does the rising Sun affright.<br>
  Every wolf's and lion's howl<br>
  Raises from Hell a human soul.</p>

  <p>He who respects the infant's faith<br>
  Triumphs over Hell and Death.<br>
  The child's toys and the old man's reasons<br>
  Are the fruits of the two seasons.<br>
  The questioner, who sits so sly,<br>
  Shall never know how to reply.<br>
  He who replies to words of doubt<br>
  Doth put the light of Knowledge out.<br>
  The strongest poison ever known<br>
  Came from Caesar's laurel crown,<br>
  Nought can deform the human race<br>
  Like to the armour's iron brace.<br>
  When gold and gems adorn the plow<br>
  To peaceful arts shall Envy bow.<br>
  A riddle or the cricket's cry<br>
  Is to doubt a fit reply.<br>
  The emmet's inch and eagle's mile<br>
  Make lame Philosophy to smile.<br>
  He who doubts from what he sees<br>
  Will ne'er believe, do what you please.<br>
  If the Sun and Moon should doubt,<br>
  They'd immediately go out.<br>
  To be in a passion you good may do,<br>
  But no good if a passion is in you.<br>
  The whore and gambler, by the state<br>
  Licens'd, build that nation's fate.<br>
  The harlot's cry from street to street,<br>
  Shall weave Old England's winding sheet.<br>
  The winner's shout, the loser's curse,<br>
  Dance before dead England's hearse.<br>
  Every night and every morn<br>
  Some to misery are born.<br>
  Every morn and every night<br>
  Some are born to sweet delight.<br>
  Some are born to sweet delight,<br>
  Some are born to endless night.<br>
  We are led to believe a lie<br>
  When we see not thro' the eye<br>
  Which was born in a night to perish in a night,<br>
  When the Soul slept in beams of light.<br>
  God appears and God is light<br>
  To those poor souls who dwell in night,<br>
  But does a human form display<br>
  To those who dwell in realms of day.</p>

  <p>When a friend calls to me from the road<br>
  And slows his horse to a meaning walk,<br>
  I don't stand still and look around<br>
  On all the hills I haven't hoed,<br>
  And shout from where I am, What is it?<br>
  No, not as there is a time to talk.<br>
  I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,<br>
  Blade-end up and five feet tall,<br>
  And plod: I go up to the stone wall<br>
  For a friendly visit.</p>

  <h2 class="title">All the world’s a stage</h2>
  <p class="author">By William Shakespeare<br>(from <em>As You Like It</em>, spoken by Jaques)</p>

  <p>All the world’s a stage,<br>
  And all the men and women merely players;<br>
  They have their exits and their entrances;<br>
  And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
  His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br>
  Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;<br>
  And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel<br>
  And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
  Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
  Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
  Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
  Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,<br>
  Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
  Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
  Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
  In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,<br>
  With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
  Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
  And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
  Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,<br>
  With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br>
  His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide<br>
  For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br>
  Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
  And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
  That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
  Is second childishness and mere oblivion;<br>
  Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>

  <p>Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,<br>
  The flying cloud, the frosty light;<br>
  The year is dying in the night;<br>
  Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.</p>

  <p>Ring out the old, ring in the new,<br>
  Ring, happy bells, across the snow:<br>
  The year is going, let him go;<br>
  Ring out the false, ring in the true.</p>

  <p>Ring out the grief that saps the mind,<br>
  For those that here we see no more,<br>
  Ring out the feud of rich and poor,<br>
  Ring in redress to all mankind.</p>

  <p>Ring out a slowly dying cause,<br>
  And ancient forms of party strife;<br>
  Ring in the nobler modes of life,<br>
  With sweeter manners, purer laws.</p>

  <p>Ring out the want, the care the sin,<br>
  The faithless coldness of the times;<br>
  Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,<br>
  But ring the fuller minstrel in.</p>

  <p>Ring out false pride in place and blood,<br>
  The civic slander and the spite;<br>
  Ring in the love of truth and right,<br>
  Ring in the common love of good.</p>

  <p>Ring out old shapes of foul disease,<br>
  Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;<br>
  Ring out the thousand wars of old,<br>
  Ring in the thousand years of peace.</p>

  <p>Ring in the valiant man and free,<br>
  The larger heart, the kindlier hand;<br>
  Ring out the darkness of the land,<br>
  Ring in the Christ that is to be.</p>

  <h2 class="title">The Walrus and the Carpenter</h2>
  <p class="author">By Lewis Carroll</p>

  <p>"The sun was shining on the sea,<br>
      Shining with all his might:<br>
He did his very best to make<br>
      The billows smooth and bright —<br>
And this was odd, because it was<br>
      The middle of the night.<br><br>

The moon was shining sulkily,<br>
      Because she thought the sun<br>
Had got no business to be there<br>
      After the day was done —<br>
"It's very rude of him," she said,<br>
      "To come and spoil the fun."<br><br>

The sea was wet as wet could be,<br>
      The sands were dry as dry.<br>
You could not see a cloud, because<br>
      No cloud was in the sky:<br>
No birds were flying overhead —<br>
      There were no birds to fly.<br><br>

The Walrus and the Carpenter<br>
      Were walking close at hand;<br>
They wept like anything to see<br>
      Such quantities of sand:<br>
'If this were only cleared away,'<br>
      They said, it would be grand!'<br><br>

If seven maids with seven mops<br>
      Swept it for half a year,<br>
'Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,<br>
      'That they could get it clear?'<br>
'I doubt it,' said the Carpenter,<br>
      And shed a bitter tear.<br><br>

O Oysters, come and walk with us!'<br>
      The Walrus did beseech.<br>
A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br>
      Along the briny beach:<br>
We cannot do with more than four,<br>
      To give a hand to each.'<br><br>

The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br>
      But never a word he said:<br>
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br>
      And shook his heavy head —<br>
Meaning to say he did not choose<br>
      To leave the oyster-bed.<br><br>

But four young Oysters hurried up,<br>
      All eager for the treat:<br>
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,<br>
      Their shoes were clean and neat —<br>
And this was odd, because, you know,<br>
      They hadn't any feet.<br><br>

Four other Oysters followed them,<br>
      And yet another four;<br>
And thick and fast they came at last,<br>
      And more, and more, and more —<br>
All hopping through the frothy waves,<br>
      And scrambling to the shore.<br><br>

The Walrus and the Carpenter<br>
      Walked on a mile or so,<br>
And then they rested on a rock<br>
      Conveniently low:<br>
And all the little Oysters stood<br>
      And waited in a row.<br><br>

The time has come,' the Walrus said,<br>
      To talk of many things:<br>
Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —<br>
      Of cabbages — and kings —<br>
And why the sea is boiling hot —<br>
      And whether pigs have wings.'<br><br>

But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,<br>
      Before we have our chat;<br>
For some of us are out of breath,<br>
      And all of us are fat!'<br>
No hurry!' said the Carpenter.<br>
      They thanked him much for that.<br><br>

A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,<br>
      Is what we chiefly need:<br>
Pepper and vinegar besides<br>
      Are very good indeed —<br>
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br>
      We can begin to feed.'<br><br>

But not on us!' the Oysters cried,<br>
      Turning a little blue.<br>
After such kindness, that would be<br>
      A dismal thing to do!'<br>
The night is fine,' the Walrus said.<br>
      Do you admire the view?<br><br>

It was so kind of you to come!<br>
      And you are very nice!'<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
      Cut us another slice:<br>
I wish you were not quite so deaf —<br>
      I've had to ask you twice!'<br><br>

It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,<br>
      To play them such a trick,<br>
After we've brought them out so far,<br>
      And made them trot so quick!'<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
      The butter's spread too thick!'<br><br>

I weep for you,' the Walrus said:<br>
      I deeply sympathize.'<br>
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br>
      Those of the largest size,<br>
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br>
      Before his streaming eyes.<br><br>

O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,<br>
      You've had a pleasant run!<br>
Shall we be trotting home again?'<br>
      But answer came there none —<br>
And this was scarcely odd, because<br>
      They'd eaten every one."</p>

  <p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>

All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
      The frumious Bandersnatch!”<br><br>

He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>
      Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>
      And stood awhile in thought.<br><br>

And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
      And burbled as it came!<br><br>

One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
He left it dead, and with its head<br>
      He went galumphing back.<br><br>

“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br>
      He chortled in his joy.<br><br>

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>

All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>

  <p class="author">By Edward Lear</p>

  <p><strong>I</strong><br>
The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea<br>
   In a beautiful pea-green boat,<br>
They took some honey, and plenty of money,<br>
   Wrapped up in a five-pound note.<br>
The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br>
   And sang to a small guitar,<br>
"O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love,<br>
    What a beautiful Pussy you are,<br>
         You are,<br>
         You are!<br>
What a beautiful Pussy you are!"</p>

  <p><strong>II</strong><br>
Pussy said to the Owl, "You elegant fowl!<br>
   How charmingly sweet you sing!<br>
O let us be married! too long we have tarried:<br>
   But what shall we do for a ring?"<br>
They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br>
   To the land where the Bong-Tree grows<br>
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood<br>
   With a ring at the end of his nose,<br>
             His nose,<br>
             His nose,<br>
   With a ring at the end of his nose.</p>

  <p><strong>III</strong><br>
"Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br>
   Your ring?" Said the Piggy, "I will."<br>
So they took it away, and were married next day<br>
   By the Turkey who lives on the hill.<br>
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,<br>
   Which they ate with a runcible spoon;<br>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,<br>
   They danced by the light of the moon,<br>
             The moon,<br>
             The moon,<br>
They danced by the light of the moon.</p>

  <p>The gingham dog and the calico cat<br>
Side by side on the table sat;<br>
'T was half-past twelve, and (what do you think!)<br>
Nor one nor t' other had slept a wink!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeared to know as sure as fate<br>
There was going to be a terrible spat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I was n't there; I simply state<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was told to me by the Chinese plate!)</p>

  <p>The gingham dog went "Bow-wow-wow!"<br>
And the calico cat replied "Mee-ow!"<br>
The air was littered, an hour or so,<br>
With bits of gingham and calico,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the old Dutch clock in the chimney-place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up with its hands before its face,<br>
For it always dreaded a family row!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Now mind: I'm only telling you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the old Dutch clock declares is true!)</p>

  <p>The Chinese plate looked very blue,<br>
And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do!"<br>
But the gingham dog and the calico cat<br>
Wallowed this way and tumbled that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employing every tooth and claw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the awfullest way you ever saw—<br>
And, oh! how the gingham and calico flew!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Don't fancy I exaggerate—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got my news from the Chinese plate!)</p>

  <p>Next morning, where the two had sat<br>
They found no trace of dog or cat;<br>
And some folks think unto this day<br>
That burglars stole that pair away!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the truth about the cat and pup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this: they ate each other up!<br>
Now what do you really think of that!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The old Dutch clock it told me so,<br>

  <h2 class="title">Casey at the Bat</h2>
  <p class="author">By Ernest Lawrence Thayer</p>

  <p>The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;<br>
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,<br>
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br>
A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.</p>

  <p>A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest<br>
Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;<br>
They thought, "If only Casey could but get a whack at that—<br>
We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat."</p>

  <p>But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br>
And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;<br>
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br>
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.</p>

  <p>But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br>
And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;<br>
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,<br>
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.</p>

  <p>Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;<br>
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;<br>
It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br>
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.</p>

  <p>There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;<br>
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.<br>
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br>
No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.</p>

  <p>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;<br>
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;<br>
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br>
Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.</p>

  <p>And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br>
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.<br>
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—<br>
"That ain't my style," said Casey. "Strike one!" the umpire said.</p>

  <p>From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br>
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;<br>
"Kill him! Kill the umpire!" shouted some one on the stand;<br>
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.</p>

  <p>With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;<br>
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;<br>
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;<br>
But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, "Strike two!"</p>

  <p>"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered "Fraud!"<br>
But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.<br>
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,<br>
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.</p>

  <p>The sneer has fled from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;<br>
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.<br>
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go.<br>
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.</p>

  <p>Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;<br>
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,<br>
And somewhere men are laughing, and little children shout;<br>
But there is no joy in Mudville—great Casey has struck out.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Smart</h2>
  <p class="author">By Shel Silverstein</p>

  <p>My dad gave me one dollar bill<br>
'Cause I'm his smartest son,<br>
And I swapped it for two shiny quarters<br>
'Cause two is more then one!</p>

  <p>And then I took the quarters<br>
And traded them to Lou<br>
For three dimes-- I guess he didn't know<br>
That three is more than two!</p>

  <p>Just then, along came old blind Bates<br>
And just 'cause he can't see<br>
He gave me four nickels for my three dimes,<br>
And four is more than three!</p>

  <p>And I took the nickels to Hiram Coombs<br>
Down at the seed-feed store,<br>
And the fool gave me five pennies for them,<br>
And five is more than four!</p>

  <p>And I went and showed my dad,<br>
And he got red in the cheeks<br>
And closed his eyes and shook his head--<br>
Too proud of me to speak!</p>

  <h2 class="title">The Guest House</h2>
  <p class="author">By Rumi</p>

  <p>This being human is a guest house.<br>
  Every morning a new arrival.</p>

  <p>A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br>
  some momentary awareness comes<br>
  As an unexpected visitor.</p>

  <p>Welcome and entertain them all!<br>
  Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,<br>
  who violently sweep your house<br>
  empty of its furniture,<br>
  still treat each guest honorably.<br>
  He may be clearing you out<br>
  for some new delight.</p>

  <p>The dark thought, the shame, the malice,<br>
  meet them at the door laughing,<br>
  and invite them in.</p>

  <p>Be grateful for whoever comes,<br>
  because each has been sent<br>
  as a guide from beyond.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Ithaka</h2>
  <p class="author">By C. P. Cavafy</p>

  <p>As you set out for Ithaka<br>
hope your road is a long one,<br>
full of adventure, full of discovery.<br>
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:<br>
you’ll never find things like that on your way<br>
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,<br>
as long as a rare excitement<br>
stirs your spirit and your body.<br>
Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them<br>
unless you bring them along inside your soul,<br>
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.</p>

  <p>Hope your road is a long one.<br>
May there be many summer mornings when,<br>
with what pleasure, what joy,<br>
you enter harbors you’re seeing for the first time;<br>
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations<br>
to buy fine things,<br>
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br>
sensual perfume of every kind—<br>
as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br>
and may you visit many Egyptian cities<br>
to learn and go on learning from their scholars.</p>

  <p>Keep Ithaka always in your mind.<br>
Arriving there is what you’re destined for.<br>
But don’t hurry the journey at all.<br>
Better if it lasts for years,<br>
so you’re old by the time you reach the island,<br>
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way,<br>
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.</p>

  <p>Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.<br>
Without her you wouldn't have set out.<br>
She has nothing left to give you now.</p>

  <p>And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.<br>
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,<br>
you’ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Four Quartets: Burnt Norton</h2>
  <p class="author">By T. S. Eliot</p>

  <p><strong>I</strong></p>

  <p>Time present and time past<br>
Are both perhaps present in time future,<br>
And time future contained in time past.<br>
If all time is eternally present<br>
All time is unredeemable.<br>
What might have been is an abstraction<br>
Remaining a perpetual possibility<br>
Only in a world of speculation.<br>
What might have been and what has been<br>
Point to one end, which is always present.<br>
Footfalls echo in the memory<br>
Down the passage which we did not take<br>
Towards the door we never opened<br>
Into the rose-garden. My words echo<br>
Thus, in your mind.<br>
But to what purpose<br>
Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose—leaves<br>
I do not know.<br>
Other echoes<br>
Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?<br>
Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,<br>
Round the corner. Through the first gate,<br>
Into our first world, shall we follow<br>
The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.<br>
There they were, dignified, invisible,<br>
Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,<br>
In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,<br>
And the bird called, in response to<br>
The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,<br>
And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses<br>
Had the look of flowers that are looked at.<br>
There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.<br>
So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,<br>
Along the empty alley, into the box circle,<br>
To look down into the drained pool.<br>
Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,<br>
And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,<br>
And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,<br>
The surface glittered out of heart of light,<br>
And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.<br>
Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.<br>
Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,<br>
Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.<br>
Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind<br>
Cannot bear very much reality.<br>
Time past and time future<br>
What might have been and what has been<br>
Point to one end, which is always present.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Whispers of Immortality</h2>
  <p class="author">By T. S. Eliot</p>

  <p>Webster was much possessed by death<br>
And saw the skull beneath the skin;<br>
And breastless creatures under ground<br>
Leaned backward with a lipless grin.</p>

  <p>Daffodil bulbs instead of balls<br>
Stared from the sockets of the eyes!<br>
He knew that thought clings round dead limbs<br>
Tightening its lusts and luxuries.</p>

  <p>Donne, I suppose, was such another<br>
Who found no substitute for sense,<br>
To seize and clutch and penetrate;<br>
Expert beyond experience,</p>

  <p>He knew the anguish of the marrow<br>
The ague of the skeleton;<br>
No contact possible to flesh<br>
Allayed the fever of the bone.</p>

  <p>                         .  .  .  .  .</p>

  <p>Grishkin is nice: her Russian eye<br>
Is underlined for emphasis;<br>
Uncorseted, her friendly bust<br>
Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.</p>

  <p>The couched Brazilian jaguar<br>
Compels the scampering marmoset<br>
With subtle effluence of cat;<br>
Grishkin has a maisonnette;</p>

  <p>The sleek Brazilian jaguar<br>
Does not in its arboreal gloom<br>
Distil so rank a feline smell<br>
As Grishkin in a drawing-room.</p>

  <p>And even the Abstract Entities<br>
Circumambulate her charm;<br>
But our lot crawls between dry ribs<br>
To keep our metaphysics warm.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Hymn to Intellectual Beauty</h2>
  <p class="author">By Percy Bysshe Shelley</p>

  <p>
The awful shadow of some unseen Power<br>
Floats though unseen among us; visiting<br>
This various world with as inconstant wing<br>
As summer winds that creep from flower to flower;<br>
Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It visits with inconstant glance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each human heart and countenance;<br>
Like hues and harmonies of evening,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like clouds in starlight widely spread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like memory of music fled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like aught that for its grace may be<br>
Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery.</p>

  <p>
Spirit of BEAUTY, that dost consecrate<br>
With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon<br>
Of human thought or form, where art thou gone?<br>
Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,<br>
This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask why the sunlight not for ever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaves rainbows o'er yon mountain-river,<br>
Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why fear and dream and death and birth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast on the daylight of this earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such gloom, why man has such a scope<br>
For love and hate, despondency and hope?</p>

  <p>
No voice from some sublimer world hath ever<br>
To sage or poet these responses given:<br>
Therefore the names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven,<br>
Remain the records of their vain endeavour:<br>
Frail spells whose utter'd charm might not avail to sever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all we hear and all we see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt, chance and mutability.<br>
Thy light alone like mist o'er mountains driven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or music by the night-wind sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through strings of some still instrument,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or moonlight on a midnight stream,<br>
Gives grace and truth to life's unquiet dream.</p>

  <p>
Love, Hope, and Self-esteem, like clouds depart<br>
And come, for some uncertain moments lent.<br>
Man were immortal and omnipotent,<br>
Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art,<br>
Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou messenger of sympathies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wax and wane in lovers' eyes;<br>
Thou, that to human thought art nourishment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like darkness to a dying flame!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depart not as thy shadow came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depart not—lest the grave should be,<br>
Like life and fear, a dark reality.</p>

  <p>
While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and sped<br>
Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin,<br>
And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing<br>
Hopes of high talk with the departed dead.<br>
I call'd on poisonous names with which our youth is fed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not heard; I saw them not;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When musing deeply on the lot<br>
Of life, at that sweet time when winds are wooing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All vital things that wake to bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News of birds and blossoming,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden, thy shadow fell on me;<br>
I shriek'd, and clasp'd my hands in ecstasy!</p>

  <p>
I vow'd that I would dedicate my powers<br>
To thee and thine: have I not kept the vow?<br>
With beating heart and streaming eyes, even now<br>
I call the phantoms of a thousand hours<br>
Each from his voiceless grave: they have in vision'd bowers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of studious zeal or love's delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outwatch'd with me the envious night:<br>
They know that never joy illum'd my brow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlink'd with hope that thou wouldst free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world from its dark slavery,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou, O awful LOVELINESS,<br>
Wouldst give whate'er these words cannot express.</p>

  <p>
The day becomes more solemn and serene<br>
When noon is past; there is a harmony<br>
In autumn, and a lustre in its sky,<br>
Which through the summer is not heard or seen,<br>
As if it could not be, as if it had not been!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus let thy power, which like the truth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nature on my passive youth<br>
Descended, to my onward life supply<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its calm, to one who worships thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every form containing thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom, SPIRIT fair, thy spells did bind<br>
To fear himself, and love all human kind.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Law Like Love</h2>
  <p class="author">By W. H. Auden</p>

  <p>
Law, say the gardeners, is the sun,<br>
Law is the one<br>
All gardeners obey<br>
Tomorrow, yesterday, today.
  </p>

  <p>
Law is the wisdom of the old,<br>
The impotent grandfathers feebly scold;<br>
The grandchildren put out a treble tongue,<br>
Law is the senses of the young.
  </p>

  <p>
Law, says the priest with a priestly look,<br>
Expounding to an unpriestly people,<br>
Law is the words in my priestly book<br>
Law is my pulpit and my steeple.<br>
Law, says the judge as he looks down his nose,<br>
Speaking clearly and most severly,<br>
Law is as I've told you before,<br>
Law is but let me explain it once more,<br>
Law is The Law.
  </p>

  <p>
Yet law-abiding scholars write:<br>
Law is neither wrong nor right,<br>
Law is only crimes<br>
Punished by places and by times,<br>
Law is the clothes men wear<br>
Anytime, anwhere.<br>
Law is Good-morning and Good-night.
  </p>

  <p>
Others say, Law is our Fate;<br>
Others say, Law is our State;<br>
Others say, others say<br>
Law is no more.<br>
Law has gone away.
  </p>

  <p>
And always the loud angry crowd,<br>
Very angry and very loud,<br>
Law is We,<br>
And always the soft idiot softly Me.
  </p>

  <p>
If we, dear, know we know no more<br>
Than they about the Law,<br>
If I no more than you<br>
Know what we should and should not do<br>
Except that all agree<br>
Gladly or miserably<br>
That the Law is<br>
And that all know this,<br>
If therefore thinking it absurd<br>
To identify Law with some other word,<br>
Unlike so many men<br>
I cannot saw Law is again<br>
No more than they can we suppress<br>
The universal wish to guess<br>
Or slip out of our own position<br>
Into an unconcerned condition.
  </p>

  <p>
Although I can at least confine<br>
Your vanity and mine<br>
To stating timidly<br>
A timid similarity,<br>
We shall boast anyway:<br>
Like Love I say.
  </p>

  <p>
Like love we don't know where or why,<br>
Like love we can't compel or fly,<br>
Like love we often weep.<br>
Like love we seldom keep.

  <p>
I have been one acquainted with the night.<br>
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.<br>
I have outwalked the furthest city light.<br><br>

I have looked down the saddest city lane.<br>
I have passed by the watchman on his beat<br>
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.<br><br>

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet<br>
When far away an interrupted cry<br>
Came over houses from another street,<br><br>

But not to call me back or say good-bye;<br>
And further still at an unearthly height,<br>
One luminary clock against the sky<br><br>

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.<br>
I have been one acquainted with the night.

How to find my soul a home<br>

And I don't believe I'm wrong<br>
That nobody,<br>

Alone, all alone<br>
Nobody, but nobody<br>
Can make it out here alone.<br><br>

There are some millionaires<br>
With money they can't use<br>
Their wives run round like banshees<br>
Their children sing the blues<br>
They've got expensive doctors<br>
To cure their hearts of stone.<br>
But nobody<br>
No, nobody<br>

Alone, all alone<br>
Nobody, but nobody<br>

Now if you listen closely<br>
I'll tell you what I know<br>
Storm clouds are gathering<br>
The wind is gonna blow<br>
The race of man is suffering<br>
And I can hear the moan,<br>

Alone, all alone<br>
Nobody, but nobody<br>

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,<br>
And Mourners to and fro<br>

And when they all were seated,<br>
A Service, like a Drum -<br>
Kept beating - beating - till I thought<br>

And then I heard them lift a Box<br>
And creak across my Soul<br>
With those same Boots of Lead, again,<br>
Then Space - began to toll,<br><br>

As all the Heavens were a Bell,<br>
And Being, but an Ear,<br>
And I, and Silence, some strange Race,<br>
Wrecked, solitary, here -<br><br>

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,<br>

  <p>
Laugh, and the world laughs with you;<br>
Weep, and you weep alone;<br>
For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,<br>
But has trouble enough of its own.<br><br>

Sing, and the hills will answer;<br>
Sigh, it is lost on the air;<br>
The echoes bound to a joyful sound,<br>
But shrink from voicing care.<br><br>

Rejoice, and men will seek you;<br>
Grieve, and they turn and go;<br>
They want full measure of all your pleasure,<br>
But they do not need your woe.<br><br>

Be glad, and your friends are many;<br>
Be sad, and you lose them all,—<br>
There are none to decline your nectared wine,<br>
But alone you must drink life’s gall.<br><br>

Feast, and your halls are crowded;<br>
Fast, and the world goes by.<br>
Succeed and give, and it helps you live,<br>
But no man can help you die.<br><br>

There is room in the halls of pleasure<br>
For a large and lordly train,<br>
But one by one we must all file on<br>
Through the narrow aisles of pain.

<div class="poem">
  <h2 class="title">The Raven</h2>
  <p class="author">By Edgar Allan Poe</p>

  <p>
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
Only this and nothing more.”<br><br>

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
Nameless here for evermore.<br><br>

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>
This it is and nothing more.”<br><br>

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>
Darkness there and nothing more.<br><br>

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br>
Merely this and nothing more.<br><br>

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>
“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<br>
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br>
’Tis the wind and nothing more!”<br><br>

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br>
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br>
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br><br>

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br>
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br>
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br><br>

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br>
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br>
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
With such name as “Nevermore.”<br><br>

But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br>
Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br>
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<br>
Then the bird said “Nevermore.”<br><br>

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br>
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”<br><br>

But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br>
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br>
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>
Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”<br><br>

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br>
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br>
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br>
She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br><br>

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br>
Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;<br>
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br>
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br><br>

“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br>
On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br>
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br>
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br><br>

“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br>
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br>
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br><br>

“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<br>
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br>
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br>
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br>
Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”<br><br>

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br>
And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
Shall be lifted—nevermore!

  <h2 class="title">Desert Places</h2>
  <p class="author">By Robert Frost</p>

  <p>
Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast<br>
In a field I looked into going past,<br>
And the ground almost covered smooth in snow,<br>
But a few weeds and stubble showing last.<br><br>

The woods around it have it - it is theirs.<br>
All animals are smothered in their lairs.<br>
I am too absent-spirited to count;<br>
The loneliness includes me unawares.<br><br>

And lonely as it is, that loneliness<br>
Will be more lonely ere it will be less -<br>
A blanker whiteness of benighted snow<br>
With no expression, nothing to express.<br><br>

They cannot scare me with their empty spaces<br>
Between stars - on stars where no human race is.<br>
I have it in me so much nearer home<br>
To scare myself with my own desert places.

  <h2 class="title">The House With Nobody In It</h2>
  <p class="author">By Joyce Kilmer</p>

  <p>
Whenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie track<br>
I go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.<br>
I suppose I've passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minute<br>
And look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it.<br><br>

I never have seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;<br>
That they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings.<br>
I know this house isn't haunted, and I wish it were, I do;<br>
For it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two.<br><br>

This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,<br>
And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.<br>
It needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and tied;<br>
But what it needs the most of all is some people living inside.<br><br>

If I had a lot of money and all my debts were paid<br>
I'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.<br>
I'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to be<br>
And I'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free.<br><br>

Now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,<br>
Looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store.<br>
But there's nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and lone<br>
For the lack of something within it that it has never known.<br><br>

But a house that has done what a house should do,<br>
a house that has sheltered life,<br>
That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,<br>
A house that has echoed a baby's laugh and held up his stumbling feet,<br>
Is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet.<br><br>

So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie track<br>
I never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,<br>
Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart,<br>
For I can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart.

  <h2 class="title">To One in Paradise</h2>
  <p class="author">By Edgar Allan Poe</p>

  <p>
Thou wast that all to me, love,<br>
For which my soul did pine—<br>
A green isle in the sea, love,<br>
A fountain and a shrine,<br>
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,<br>
And all the flowers were mine.<br><br>

Ah, dream too bright to last!<br>
Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise<br>
But to be overcast!<br>
A voice from out the Future cries,<br>
“On! on!”—but o’er the Past<br>
(Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies<br>
Mute, motionless, aghast!<br><br>

For, alas! alas! with me<br>
The light of Life is o’er!<br>
No more—no more—no more—<br>
(Such language holds the solemn sea<br>
To the sands upon the shore)<br>
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,<br>
Or the stricken eagle soar!<br><br>

And all my days are trances,<br>
And all my nightly dreams<br>
Are where thy grey eye glances,<br>
And where thy footstep gleams—<br>
In what ethereal dances,<br>
By what eternal streams.

  <h2 class="title">I Am!</h2>
  <p class="author">By John Clare</p>

  <p>
I am! yet what I am who cares, or knows?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends forsake me like a memory lost.<br>
I am the self-consumer of my woes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rise and vanish, an oblivious host,<br>
Shadows of life, whose very soul is lost.<br>
And yet I am—I live—though I am toss'd<br><br>

Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the living sea of waking dream,<br>
Where there is neither sense of life, nor joys,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the huge shipwreck of my own esteem<br>
And all that's dear. Even those I loved the best<br>
Are strange—nay, they are stranger than the rest.<br><br>

I long for scenes where man has never trod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For scenes where woman never smiled or wept;<br>
There to abide with my Creator, God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept<br>
Full of high thoughts, unborn. So let me lie,<br>
The grass below; above the vaulted sky.

  <h2 class="title">Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night</h2>

  <p>
Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br><br>

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br><br>

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>

And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

  <h2 class="title">And Death Shall Have No Dominion</h2>

  <p>
And death shall have no dominion.<br>
Dead man naked they shall be one<br>
With the man in the wind and the west moon;<br>
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,<br>
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;<br>
Though they go mad they shall be sane,<br>
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;<br>
Though lovers be lost love shall not;<br>
And death shall have no dominion.<br><br>

And death shall have no dominion.<br>
Under the windings of the sea<br>
They lying long shall not die windily;<br>
Twisting on racks when sinews give way,<br>
Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;<br>
Faith in their hands shall snap in two,<br>
And the unicorn evils run them through;<br>
Split all ends up they shan't crack;<br>
And death shall have no dominion.<br><br>

And death shall have no dominion.<br>
No more may gulls cry at their ears<br>
Or waves break loud on the seashores;<br>
Where blew a flower may a flower no more<br>
Lift its head to the blows of the rain;<br>
Though they be mad and dead as nails,<br>
Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;<br>
Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,<br>
And death shall have no dominion.

  <h2 class="title">Fern Hill</h2>

  <p>
Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs<br>
About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,<br>
The night above the dingle starry,<br>
Time let me hail and climb<br>
Golden in the heydays of his eyes,<br>
And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns<br>
And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves<br>
Trail with daisies and barley<br>
Down the rivers of the windfall light.
  </p>

  <p>
And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns<br>
About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,<br>
In the sun that is young once only,<br>
Time let me play and be<br>
Golden in the mercy of his means,<br>
And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves<br>
Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,<br>
And the sabbath rang slowly<br>
In the pebbles of the holy streams.
  </p>

  <p>
All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay<br>
Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air<br>
And playing, lovely and watery<br>
And fire green as grass.<br>
And nightly under the simple stars<br>
As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,<br>
All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars<br>
Flying with the ricks, and the horses<br>
Flashing into the dark.
  </p>

  <p>
And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white<br>
With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all<br>
Shining, it was Adam and maiden,<br>
The sky gathered again<br>
And the sun grew round that very day.<br>
So it must have been after the birth of the simple light<br>
In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm<br>
Out of the whinnying green stable<br>
On to the fields of praise.
  </p>

  <p>
And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house<br>
Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,<br>
In the sun born over and over,<br>
I ran my heedless ways,<br>
My wishes raced through the house high hay<br>
And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows<br>
In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs<br>
Before the children green and golden<br>
Follow him out of grace.
  </p>

  <p>
Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me<br>
Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,<br>
In the moon that is always rising,<br>
Nor that riding to sleep<br>
I should hear him fly with the high fields<br>
And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.<br>
Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,<br>
Time held me green and dying<br>
Though I sang in my chains like the sea.

It would crumble;<br>
It is so sad and beautiful,<br>
So tremulously like a dream.

  <h2 class="title">A Refusal To Mourn The Death, By Fire, Of A Child In London</h2>

  <p>
Never until the mankind making<br>
Bird beast and flower<br>
Fathering and all humbling darkness<br>
Tells with silence the last light breaking<br>
And the still hour<br>
Is come of the sea tumbling in harness
  </p>

  <p>
And I must enter again the round<br>
Zion of the water bead<br>
And the synagogue of the ear of corn<br>
Shall I let pray the shadow of a sound<br>
Or sow my salt seed<br>
In the least valley of sackcloth to mourn
  </p>

  <p>
The majesty and burning of the child's death.<br>
I shall not murder<br>
The mankind of her going with a grave truth<br>
Nor blaspheme down the stations of the breath<br>
With any further<br>
Elegy of innocence and youth.
  </p>

  <p>
Deep with the first dead lies London's daughter,<br>
Robed in the long friends,<br>
The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,<br>
Secret by the unmourning water<br>
Of the riding Thames.<br>
After the first death, there is no other.

  <h2 class="title">A Process In The Weather Of The Heart</h2>

  <p>
A process in the weather of the heart<br>
Turns damp to dry; the golden shot<br>
Storms in the freezing tomb.<br>
A weather in the quarter of the veins<br>
Turns night to day; blood in their suns<br>
Lights up the living worm.
  </p>

  <p>
A process in the eye forwarns<br>
The bones of blindness; and the womb<br>
Drives in a death as life leaks out.
  </p>

  <p>
A darkness in the weather of the eye<br>
Is half its light; the fathomed sea<br>
Breaks on unangled land.<br>
The seed that makes a forest of the loin<br>
Forks half its fruit; and half drops down,<br>
Slow in a sleeping wind.
  </p>

  <p>
A weather in the flesh and bone<br>
Is damp and dry; the quick and dead<br>
Move like two ghosts before the eye.
  </p>

  <p>
A process in the weather of the world<br>
Turns ghost to ghost; each mothered child<br>
Sits in their double shade.<br>
A process blows the moon into the sun,<br>
Pulls down the shabby curtains of the skin;<br>
And the heart gives up its dead.

  <h2 class="title">A Letter To My Aunt Discussing The Correct Approach To Modern Poetry</h2>

  <p>
To you, my aunt, who would explore<br>
The literary Chankley Bore,<br>
The paths are hard, for you are not<br>
A literary Hottentot<br>
But just a kind and cultured dame<br>
Who knows not Eliot (to her shame).<br>
Fie on you, aunt, that you should see<br>
No genius in David G.,<br>
No elemental form and sound<br>
In T.S.E. and Ezra Pound.<br>
Fie on you, aunt! I'll show you how<br>
To elevate your middle brow,<br>
And how to scale and see the sights<br>
From modernist Parnassian heights.
  </p>

  <p>
First buy a hat, no Paris model<br>
But one the Swiss wear when they yodel,<br>
A bowler thing with one or two<br>
Feathers to conceal the view;<br>
And then in sandals walk the street<br>
(All modern painters use their feet<br>
For painting, on their canvas strips,<br>
Their wives or mothers, minus hips).
  </p>

  <p>
Perhaps it would be best if you<br>
Created something very new,<br>
A dirty novel done in Erse<br>
Or written backwards in Welsh verse,<br>
Or paintings on the backs of vests,<br>
Or Sanskrit psalms on lepers' chests.<br>
But if this proved imposs-i-ble<br>
Perhaps it would be just as well,<br>
For you could then write what you please,<br>
And modern verse is done with ease.
  </p>

  <p>
Do not forget that 'limpet' rhymes<br>
With 'strumpet' in these troubled times,<br>
And commas are the worst of crimes;<br>
Few understand the works of Cummings,<br>
And few James Joyce's mental slummings,<br>
And few young Auden's coded chatter;<br>
But then it is the few that matter.<br>
Never be lucid, never state,<br>
If you would be regarded great,<br>
The simplest thought or sentiment,<br>
(For thought, we know, is decadent):<br>
Never omit such vital words<br>
As belly, genitals and - - - ,<br>
For these are things that play a part<br>
(And what a part) in all good art.<br>
Remember this: each rose is wormy,<br>
And every lovely woman's germy;<br>
Remember this: that love depends<br>
On how the Gallic letter bends;<br>
Remember, too, that life is hell<br>
And even heaven has a smell<br>
Of putrefying angels who<br>
Make deadly whoopee in the blue.<br>
These things remembered, what can stop<br>
A poet going to the top?
  </p>

  <p>
A final word: before you start<br>
The convulsions of your art,<br>
Remove your brains, take out your heart;<br>
Minus these curses, you can be<br>
A genius like David G.
  </p>

  <p>
Take courage, aunt, and send your stuff<br>
To Geoffrey Grigson with my luff,<br>
And may I yet live to admire<br>
How well your poems light the fire.

  <h2 class="title">Especially When The October Wind</h2>

  <p>
Especially when the October wind<br>
With frosty fingers punishes my hair,<br>
Caught by the crabbing sun I walk on fire<br>
And cast a shadow crab upon the land,<br>
By the sea's side, hearing the noise of birds,<br>
Hearing the raven cough in winter sticks,<br>
My busy heart who shudders as she talks<br>
Sheds the syllabic blood and drains her words.
  </p>

  <p>
Shut, too, in a tower of words, I mark<br>
On the horizon walking like the trees<br>
The wordy shapes of women, and the rows<br>
Of the star-gestured children in the park.<br>
Some let me make you of the vowelled beeches,<br>
Some of the oaken voices, from the roots<br>
Of many a thorny shire tell you notes,<br>
Some let me make you of the water's speeches.
  </p>

  <p>
Behind a pot of ferns the wagging clock<br>
Tells me the hour's word, the neural meaning<br>
Flies on the shafted disk, declaims the morning<br>
And tells the windy weather in the cock.<br>
Some let me make you of the meadow's signs;<br>
The signal grass that tells me all I know<br>
Breaks with the wormy winter through the eye.<br>
Some let me tell you of the raven's sins.
  </p>

  <p>
Especially when the October wind<br>
(Some let me make you of autumnal spells,<br>
The spider-tongued, and the loud hill of Wales)<br>
With fists of turnips punishes the land,<br>
Some let me make you of the heartless words.<br>
The heart is drained that, spelling in the scurry<br>
Of chemic blood, warned of the coming fury.<br>
By the sea's side hear the dark-vowelled birds.

  <h2 class="title">After The Funeral (In Memory Of Ann Jones)</h2>

  <p>
After the funeral, mule praises, brays,<br>
Windshake of sailshaped ears, muffle-toed tap<br>
Tap happily of one peg in the thick<br>
Grave's foot, blinds down the lids, the teeth in black,<br>
The spittled eyes, the salt ponds in the sleeves,<br>
Morning smack of the spade that wakes up sleep,<br>
Shakes a desolate boy who slits his throat<br>
In the dark of the coffin and sheds dry leaves,<br>
That breaks one bone to light with a judgment clout'<br>
After the feast of tear-stuffed time and thistles<br>
In a room with a stuffed fox and a stale fern,<br>
I stand, for this memorial's sake, alone<br>
In the snivelling hours with dead, humped Ann<br>
Whose hodded, fountain heart once fell in puddles<br>
Round the parched worlds of Wales and drowned each sun<br>
(Though this for her is a monstrous image blindly<br>
Magnified out of praise; her death was a still drop;<br>
She would not have me sinking in the holy<br>
Flood of her heart's fame; she would lie dumb and deep<br>
And need no druid of her broken body).
  </p>

  <p>
But I, Ann's bard on a raised hearth, call all<br>
The seas to service that her wood-tongud virtue<br>
Babble like a bellbuoy over the hymning heads,<br>
Bow down the walls of the ferned and foxy woods<br>
That her love sing and swing through a brown chapel,<br>
Blees her bent spirit with four, crossing birds.<br>
Her flesh was meek as milk, but this skyward statue<br>
With the wild breast and blessed and giant skull<br>
Is carved from her in a room with a wet window<br>
In a fiercely mourning house in a crooked year.
  </p>

  <p>
I know her scrubbed and sour humble hands<br>
Lie with religion in their cramp, her threadbare<br>
Whisper in a damp word, her wits drilled hollow,<br>
Her fist of a face died clenched on a round pain;<br>
And sculptured Ann is seventy years of stone.<br>
These cloud-sopped, marble hands, this monumental<br>
Argument of the hewn voice, gesture and psalm<br>
Storm me forever over her grave until<br>
The stuffed lung of the fox twitch and cry Love<br>
And the strutting fern lay seeds on the black sill.

  <h2 class="title">Elegy</h2>

Too proud to die; broken and blind he died<br>
The darkest way, and did not turn away,<br>
A cold kind man brave in his narrow pride
  </p>

  <p>
On that darkest day, Oh, forever may<br>
He lie lightly, at last, on the last, crossed<br>
Hill, under the grass, in love, and there grow
  </p>

  <p>
Young among the long flocks, and never lie lost<br>
Or still all the numberless days of his death, though<br>
Above all he longed for his mother's breast
  </p>

  <p>
Which was rest and dust, and in the kind ground<br>
The darkest justice of death, blind and unblessed.<br>
Let him find no rest but be fathered and found,
  </p>

  <p>
I prayed in the crouching room, by his blind bed,<br>
In the muted house, one minute before<br>
Noon, and night, and light. the rivers of the dead
  </p>

  <p>
Veined his poor hand I held, and I saw<br>
Through his unseeing eyes to the roots of the sea.<br>
(An old tormented man three-quarters blind,
  </p>

  <p>
I am not too proud to cry that He and he<br>
Will never never go out of my mind.<br>
All his bones crying, and poor in all but pain,

  <p>
Being innocent, he dreaded that he died<br>
Hating his God, but what he was was plain:<br>
An old kind man brave in his burning pride.
  </p>

  <p>
The sticks of the house were his; his books he owned.<br>
Even as a baby he had never cried;<br>
Nor did he now, save to his secret wound.
  </p>

  <p>
Out of his eyes I saw the last light glide.<br>
Here among the light of the lording sky<br>
An old man is with me where I go
  </p>

  <p>
Walking in the meadows of his son's eye<br>
On whom a world of ills came down like snow.<br>
He cried as he died, fearing at last the spheres'
  </p>

  <p>
Last sound, the world going out without a breath:<br>
Too proud to cry, too frail to check the tears,<br>
And caught between two nights, blindness and death.
  </p>

  <p>
O deepest wound of all that he should die<br>
On that darkest day. oh, he could hide<br>
The tears out of his eyes, too proud to cry.
  </p>

  <p>
Until I die he will not leave my side.)

  <h2 class="title">All All And All The Dry Worlds Lever</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>
  <p>
All all and all the dry worlds lever,<br>
Stage of the ice, the solid ocean,<br>
All from the oil, the pound of lava.<br>
City of spring, the governed flower,<br>
Turns in the earth that turns the ashen<br>
Towns around on a wheel of fire.
  </p>
  <p>
How now my flesh, my naked fellow,<br>
Dug of the sea, the glanded morrow,<br>
Worm in the scalp, the staked and fallow.<br>
All all and all, the corpse's lover,<br>
Skinny as sin, the foaming marrow,<br>
All of the flesh, the dry worlds lever.
  </p>

  <h3>II</h3>
  <p>
Fear not the waking world, my mortal,<br>
Fear not the flat, synthetic blood,<br>
Nor the heart in the ribbing metal.<br>
Fear not the tread, the seeded milling,<br>
The trigger and scythe, the bridal blade,<br>
Nor the flint in the lover's mauling.
  </p>
  <p>
Man of my flesh, the jawbone riven,<br>
Know now the flesh's lock and vice,<br>
And the cage for the scythe-eyed raver.<br>
Know, O my bone, the jointed lever,<br>
Fear not the screws that turn the voice,<br>
And the face to the driven lover.
  </p>

  <h3>III</h3>
  <p>
All all and all the dry worlds couple,<br>
Ghost with her ghost, contagious man<br>
With the womb of his shapeless people.<br>
All that shapes from the caul and suckle,<br>
Stroke of mechanical flesh on mine,<br>
Square in these worlds the mortal circle.
  </p>
  <p>
Flower, flower the people's fusion,<br>
O light in zenith, the coupled bud,<br>
And the flame in the flesh's vision.<br>
Out of the sea, the drive of oil,<br>
Socket and grave, the brassy blood,<br>
Flower, flower, all all and all.

  <h2 class="title">Love In The Asylum</h2>

  <p>
A stranger has come<br>
To share my room in the house not right in the head,<br>
A girl mad as birds
  </p>
  <p>
Bolting the night of the door with her arm her plume.<br>
Strait in the mazed bed<br>
She deludes the heaven-proof house with entering clouds
  </p>
  <p>
Yet she deludes with walking the nightmarish room,<br>
At large as the dead,<br>
Or rides the imagined oceans of the male wards.
  </p>
  <p>
She has come possessed<br>
Who admits the delusive light through the bouncing wall,<br>
Possessed by the skies
  </p>
  <p>
She sleeps in the narrow trough yet she walks the dust<br>
Yet raves at her will<br>
On the madhouse boards worn thin by my walking tears.
  </p>
  <p>
And taken by light in her arms at long and dear last<br>
I may without fail<br>
Suffer the first vision that set fire to the stars.

  <h2 class="title">Deaths And Entrances</h2>

  <p>
On almost the incendiary eve<br>
Of several near deaths,<br>
When one at the great least of your best loved<br>
And always known must leave<br>
Lions and fires of his flying breath,<br>
Of your immortal friends<br>
Who'd raise the organs of the counted dust<br>
To shoot and sing your praise,<br>
One who called deepest down shall hold his peace<br>
That cannot sink or cease<br>
Endlessly to his wound<br>
In many married London's estranging grief.
  </p>

  <p>
On almost the incendiary eve<br>
When at your lips and keys,<br>
Locking, unlocking, the murdered strangers weave,<br>
One who is most unknown,<br>
Your polestar neighbour, sun of another street,<br>
Will dive up to his tears.<br>
He'll bathe his raining blood in the male sea<br>
Who strode for your own dead<br>
And wind his globe out of your water thread<br>
And load the throats of shells<br>
with every cry since light<br>
Flashed first across his thunderclapping eyes.
  </p>

  <p>
On almost the incendiary eve<br>
Of deaths and entrances,<br>
When near and strange wounded on London's waves<br>
Have sought your single grave,<br>
One enemy, of many, who knows well<br>
Your heart is luminous<br>
In the watched dark, quivering through locks and caves,<br>
Will pull the thunderbolts<br>
To shut the sun, plunge, mount your darkened keys<br>
And sear just riders back,<br>
Until that one loved least<br>
Looms the last Samson of your zodiac.

  <h2 class="title">Among Those Killed In The Dawn Raid Was A Man Aged A Hundred</h2>

  <p>
When the morning was waking over the war<br>
He put on his clothes and stepped out and he died,<br>
The locks yawned loose and a blast blew them wide,<br>
He dropped where he loved on the burst pavement stone<br>
And the funeral grains of the slaughtered floor.<br>
Tell his street on its back he stopped a sun<br>
And the craters of his eyes grew springshots and fire<br>
When all the keys shot from the locks, and rang.<br>
Dig no more for the chains of his grey-haired heart.<br>
The heavenly ambulance drawn by a wound<br>
Assembling waits for the spade's ring on the cage.<br>
O keep his bones away from the common cart,<br>
The morning is flying on the wings of his age<br>
And a hundred storks perch on the sun's right hand.

<div class="poem">
  <h2 class="title">Before I Knocked</h2>

  <p>
Before I knocked and flesh let enter,<br>
With liquid hands tapped on the womb,<br>
I who was as shapeless as the water<br>
That shaped the Jordan near my home<br>
Was brother to Mnetha's daughter<br>
And sister to the fathering worm.
  </p><br>

  <p>
I who was deaf to spring and summer,<br>
Who knew not sun nor moon by name,<br>
Felt thud beneath my flesh's armour,<br>
As yet was in a molten form<br>
The leaden stars, the rainy hammer<br>
Swung by my father from his dome.
  </p><br>

  <p>
I knew the message of the winter,<br>
The darted hail, the childish snow,<br>
And the wind was my sister suitor;<br>
Wind in me leaped, the hellborn dew;<br>
My veins flowed with the Eastern weather;<br>
Ungotten I knew night and day.
  </p><br>

  <p>
As yet ungotten, I did suffer;<br>
The rack of dreams my lily bones<br>
Did twist into a living cipher,<br>
And flesh was snipped to cross the lines<br>
Of gallow crosses on the liver<br>
And brambles in the wringing brains.
  </p><br>

  <p>
My throat knew thirst before the structure<br>
Of skin and vein around the well<br>
Where words and water make a mixture<br>
Unfailing till the blood runs foul;<br>
My heart knew love, my belly hunger;<br>
I smelt the maggot in my stool.
  </p><br>

  <p>
And time cast forth my mortal creature<br>
To drift or drown upon the seas<br>
Acquainted with the salt adventure<br>
Of tides that never touch the shores.<br>
I who was rich was made the richer<br>
By sipping at the vine of days.
  </p><br>

  <p>
I, born of flesh and ghost, was neither<br>
A ghost nor man, but mortal ghost.<br>
And I was struck down by death's feather.<br>
I was a mortal to the last<br>
Long breath that carried to my father<br>
The message of his dying christ.
  </p><br>

  <p>
You who bow down at cross and altar,<br>
Remember me and pity Him<br>
Who took my flesh and bone for armour<br>
And doublecrossed my mother's womb.

  <p>
And then he drank a dew<br>
From a convenient grass,<br>

He glanced with rapid eyes<br>

  <h2 class="title">Children Chapter IV</h2>

  <p>
And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, "Speak to us of Children."<br>
And he said:<br>
Your children are not your children.<br>
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.<br>
They come through you but not from you,<br>
And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.<br>
You may give them your love but not your thoughts.<br>
For they have their own thoughts.<br>
You may house their bodies but not their souls,<br>
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.<br>
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.<br>
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.<br>
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.<br>
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.<br>
Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;<br>
For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.

I would that my life remain a tear and a smile.
  </p>

  <p>
A tear to purify my heart and give me understanding<br>
Of life's secrets and hidden things.<br>
A smile to draw me nigh to the sons of my kind and<br>
To be a symbol of my glorification of the gods.
  </p>

  <p>
A tear to unite me with those of broken heart;<br>
A smile to be a sign of my joy in existence.

  <h2 class="title">Joy And Sorrow Chapter VIII</h2>

  <p>
Then a woman said, "Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow."<br><br>
And he answered:
  </p>

  <p>
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.<br><br>
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.<br><br>
And how else can it be?<br><br>
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.<br><br>
Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?<br><br>
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?<br><br>
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.<br><br>
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.<br><br>
Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater."<br><br>
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.<br><br>
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.<br><br>
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.<br><br>
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.<br><br>
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.

By the gods. Nature then takes me, to adorn<br>
Her fields and valleys.

I am beautiful pearls, plucked from the<br>
Crown of Ishtar by the daughter of Dawn<br>
To embellish the gardens.
  </p>

  <p>
When I cry the hills laugh;<br>
When I humble myself the flowers rejoice;<br>
When I bow, all things are elated.

  <p>
The field and the cloud are lovers<br>
And between them I am a messenger of mercy.<br>
I quench the thirst of one;<br>
I cure the ailment of the other.
  </p>

  <p>
The voice of thunder declares my arrival;<br>
The rainbow announces my departure.<br>
I am like earthly life, which begins at<br>
The feet of the mad elements and ends<br>
Under the upraised wings of death.
  </p>

  <p>
I emerge from the herd of the sea<br>
Soar with the breeze. When I see a field in<br>
Need, I descend and embrace the flowers and<br>
The trees in a million little ways.
  </p>

  <p>
I touch gently at the windows with my<br>
Soft fingers, and my announcement is a<br>
Welcome song. All can hear, but only<br>
The sensitive can understand.

  <p>
The heat in the air gives birth to me,<br>
But in turn I kill it,<br>
As woman overcomes man with<br>
The strength she takes from him.
  </p>

  <p>
I am the sigh of the sea;<br>
The laughter of the field;<br>
The tears of heaven.
  </p>

  <p>
So with love -<br>
Sighs from the deep sea of affection;<br>
Laughter from the colorful field of the spirit;<br>
Tears from the endless heaven of memories.

  <h2 class="title">A Lover's Call XXVII</h2>

  <p>
Where are you, my beloved? Are you in that little<br>
Paradise, watering the flowers who look upon you<br>
As infants look upon the breast of their mothers?
  </p>

  <p>
Or are you in your chamber where the shrine of<br>
Virtue has been placed in your honor, and upon<br>
Which you offer my heart and soul as sacrifice?
  </p>

  <p>
Or amongst the books, seeking human knowledge,<br>
While you are replete with heavenly wisdom?
  </p>

  <p>
Oh companion of my soul, where are you? Are you<br>
Praying in the temple? Or calling Nature in the<br>
Field, haven of your dreams?
  </p>

  <p>
Are you in the huts of the poor, consoling the<br>
Broken-hearted with the sweetness of your soul, and<br>
Filling their hands with your bounty?
  </p>

  <p>
You are God's spirit everywhere;<br>
You are stronger than the ages.
  </p>

  <p>
Do you have memory of the day we met, when the halo of<br>
You spirit surrounded us, and the Angels of Love<br>
Floated about, singing the praise of the soul's deed?
  </p>

  <p>
Do you recollect our sitting in the shade of the<br>
Branches, sheltering ourselves from Humanity, as the ribs<br>
Protect the divine secret of the heart from injury?
  </p>

  <p>
Remember you the trails and forest we walked, with hands<br>
Joined, and our heads leaning against each other, as if<br>
We were hiding ourselves within ourselves?
  </p>

  <p>
Recall you the hour I bade you farewell,<br>
And the Maritime kiss you placed on my lips?<br>
That kiss taught me that joining of lips in Love<br>
Reveals heavenly secrets which the tongue cannot utter!
  </p>

  <p>
That kiss was introduction to a great sigh,<br>
Like the Almighty's breath that turned earth into man.
  </p>

  <p>
That sigh led my way into the spiritual world,<br>
Announcing the glory of my soul; and there<br>
It shall perpetuate until again we meet.
  </p>

  <p>
I remember when you kissed me and kissed me,<br>
With tears coursing your cheeks, and you said,<br>
"Earthly bodies must often separate for earthly purpose,<br>
And must live apart impelled by worldly intent.
  </p>

  <p>
"But the spirit remains joined safely in the hands of<br>
Love, until death arrives and takes joined souls to God.
  </p>

  <p>
"Go, my beloved; Love has chosen you her delegate;<br>
Over her, for she is Beauty who offers to her follower<br>
The cup of the sweetness of life.<br>
As for my own empty arms, your love shall remain my<br>
Comforting groom; your memory, my Eternal wedding."
  </p>

  <p>
Where are you now, my other self? Are you awake in<br>
The silence of the night? Let the clean breeze convey<br>
To you my heart's every beat and affection.
  </p>

  <p>
Are you fondling my face in your memory? That image<br>
Is no longer my own, for Sorrow has dropped his<br>
Shadow on my happy countenance of the past.
  </p>

  <p>
Sobs have withered my eyes which reflected your beauty<br>
And dried my lips which you sweetened with kisses.
  </p>

  <p>
Where are you, my beloved? Do you hear my weeping<br>
From beyond the ocean? Do you understand my need?<br>
Do you know the greatness of my patience?
  </p>

  <p>
Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying<br>
To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any<br>
Secret communication between angels that will carry to<br>
You my complaint?
  </p>

  <p>
Where are you, my beautiful star? The obscurity of life<br>
Has cast me upon its bosom; sorrow has conquered me.
  </p>

  <p>
Sail your smile into the air; it will reach and enliven me!<br>
Breathe your fragrance into the air; it will sustain me!
  </p>

Where are you, me beloved?<br>
Oh, how great is Love!<br>
And how little am I!

  <p>
Love one another, but make not a bond of love.<br>
Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.<br>
Fill each other's cup, but drink not from one cup.<br>
Give one another of your bread, but eat not from the same loaf.<br>
Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone.<br>
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.<br>
Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.<br>
For only the hand of life can contain your hearts.<br>
And stand together, yet not too near together.<br>
For the pillars of the temple stand apart.<br>
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.

Your pain is the breaking of the shell<br>

Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its<br>
heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.
  </p>

  <p>
And could you keep your heart in wonder<br>
at the daily miracles of your life, your pain<br>
would not seem less wondrous than your joy;
  </p>

  <p>
And you would accept the seasons of your<br>
heart, even as you have always accepted<br>
the seasons that pass over your fields.
  </p>

  <p>
And you would watch with serenity<br>
through the winters of your grief.
  </p>

  <p>
Much of your pain is self-chosen.
  </p>

  <p>
It is the bitter potion by which the<br>
physician within you heals your sick self.
  </p>

  <p>
Therefore trust the physician, and drink<br>
his remedy in silence and tranquillity:
  </p>

  <p>
For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided<br>
by the tender hand of the Unseen,<br>
And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips,<br>
has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter<br>
has moistened with His own sacred tears.

Embalm my hair with frankincense and sprinkle my feet with perfume,<br>
And read what the hand of Death has written on my forehead.
  </p>

  <p>
Let me rest in the arms of Slumber, for my open eyes are tired;<br>
Let the silver-stringed lyre quiver and soothe my spirit;<br>
Weave from the harp and lute a veil around my withering heart.
  </p>

  <p>
Sing of the past as you behold the dawn of hope in my eyes, for<br>
Its magic meaning is a soft bed upon which my heart rests.
  </p>

  <p>
Dry your tears, my friends, and raise your heads as the flowers<br>
Raise their crowns to greet the dawn.<br>
Look at the bride of Death standing like a column of light<br>
Between my bed and the infinite;<br>
Hold your breath and listen with me to the beckoning rustle of<br>
Her white wings.
  </p>

  <p>
Come close and bid me farewell; touch my eyes with smiling lips.<br>
Let the children grasp my hands with soft and rosy fingers;<br>
Let the ages place their veined hands upon my head and bless me;<br>
Let the virgins come close and see the shadow of God in my eyes,<br>
And hear the echo of His will racing with my breath.
  </p>


  <h3>Part Two – The Ascending</h3>
  <p>
I have passed a mountain peak and my soul is soaring in the<br>
Firmament of complete and unbound freedom;<br>
I am far, far away, my companions, and the clouds are<br>
Hiding the hills from my eyes.<br>
The valleys are becoming flooded with an ocean of silence, and the<br>
Hands of oblivion are engulfing the roads and the houses;<br>
The prairies and fields are disappearing behind a white specter<br>
That looks like the spring cloud, yellow as the candlelight<br>
And red as the twilight.
  </p>

  <p>
The songs of the waves and the hymns of the streams<br>
Are scattered, and the voices of the throngs reduced to silence;<br>
And I can hear naught but the music of Eternity<br>
In exact harmony with the spirit's desires.<br>
I am cloaked in full whiteness;<br>
I am in comfort; I am in peace.
  </p>


  <h3>Part Three – The Remains</h3>
  <p>
Unwrap me from this white linen shroud and clothe me<br>
With leaves of jasmine and lilies;<br>
Take my body from the ivory casket and let it rest<br>
Upon pillows of orange blossoms.<br>
Lament me not, but sing songs of youth and joy;<br>
Shed not tears upon me, but sing of harvest and the winepress;<br>
Utter no sigh of agony, but draw upon my face with your<br>
Finger the symbol of Love and Joy.
  </p>

  <p>
Disturb not the air's tranquility with chanting and requiems,<br>
But let your hearts sing with me the song of Eternal Life;<br>
Mourn me not with apparel of black,<br>
But dress in color and rejoice with me;<br>
Talk not of my departure with sighs in your hearts; close<br>
Your eyes and you will see me with you forevermore.
  </p>

  <p>
Place me upon clusters of leaves and<br>
Carry me upon your friendly shoulders and<br>
Walk slowly to the deserted forest.<br>
Take me not to the crowded burying ground lest my slumber<br>
Be disrupted by the rattling of bones and skulls.
  </p>

  <p>
Carry me to the cypress woods and dig my grave where violets<br>
And poppies grow not in the other's shadow;<br>
Let my grave be deep so that the flood will not<br>
Carry my bones to the open valley;<br>
Let my grave be wide, so that the twilight shadows<br>
Will come and sit by me.
  </p>

  <p>
Take from me all earthly raiment and place me deep in my<br>
Mother Earth; and place me with care upon my mother's breast.<br>
Cover me with soft earth, and let each handful be mixed<br>
With seeds of jasmine, lilies and myrtle; and when they<br>
Grow above me, and thrive on my body's element they will<br>
Breathe the fragrance of my heart into space;<br>
And reveal even to the sun the secret of my peace;<br>
And sail with the breeze and comfort the wayfarer.
  </p>

  <p>
Leave me then, friends — leave me and depart on mute feet,<br>
As the silence walks in the deserted valley;<br>
Leave me to God and disperse yourselves slowly, as the almond<br>
And apple blossoms disperse under the vibration of Nisan's breeze.<br>
Go back to the joy of your dwellings and you will find there<br>
That which Death cannot remove from you and me.<br>
Leave with peace, for what you see here is far away in meaning<br>
From the earthly world. Leave me.
  </p>

  <h2 class="title">Let These Be Your Desires</h2>

  <p>
Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself.<br>
But if your love must needs have desires,<br>
Let these be your desires:
  </p>

  <p>
To melt and be like a running brook<br>
That sings its melody to the night.<br>
To know the pain of too much tenderness.<br>
To be wounded by your own understanding of love;<br>
And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
  </p>

  <p>
To wake at dawn with a winged heart<br>
And give thanks for another day of loving;<br>
To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;<br>
To return home at eventide with gratitude;<br>
And then to sleep with a prayer<br>
For the beloved in your heart<br>
And a song of praise upon your lips.

<div class="chapter">
  <h2 class="title">Chapter 9 - The Seven Selves</h2>

  <p>
In the stillest hour of the night, as I lay half asleep, my seven selves sat together and thus conversed in whisper:
  </p>

  <p>
<strong>First Self:</strong> Here, in this madman, I have dwelt all these years, with naught to do but renew his pain by day and recreate his sorrow by night. I can bear my fate no longer, and now I rebel.
  </p>

  <p>
<strong>Second Self:</strong> Yours is a better lot than mine, brother, for it is given to me to be this madman's joyous self. I laugh his laughter and sing his happy hours, and with thrice winged feet I dance his brighter thoughts. It is I that would rebel against my weary existence.
  </p>

  <p>
<strong>Third Self:</strong> And what of me, the love-ridden self, the flaming brand of wild passion and fantastic desires? It is I the love-sick self who would rebel against this madman.
  </p>

  <p>
<strong>Fourth Self:</strong> I, amongst you all, am the most miserable, for naught was given me but odious hatred and destructive loathing. It is I, the tempest-like self, the one born in the black caves of Hell, who would protest against serving this madman.
  </p>

  <p>
<strong>Fifth Self:</strong> Nay, it is I, the thinking self, the fanciful self, the self of hunger and thirst, the one doomed to wander without rest in search of unknown things and things not yet created; it is I, not you, who would rebel.
  </p>

  <p>
<strong>Sixth Self:</strong> And I, the working self, the pitiful labourer, who, with patient hands, and longing eyes, fashion the days into images and give the formless elements new and eternal forms—it is I, the solitary one, who would rebel against this restless madman.
  </p>

  <p>
<strong>Seventh Self:</strong> How strange that you all would rebel against this man, because each and every one of you has a preordained fate to fulfil. Ah! could I but be like one of you, a self with a determined lot! But I have none, I am the do-nothing self, the one who sits in the dumb, empty nowhere and nowhen, while you are busy re-creating life. Is it you or I, neighbours, who should rebel?
  </p>

  <p>
When the seventh self thus spake the other six selves looked with pity upon him but said nothing more; and as the night grew deeper one after the other went to sleep enfolded with a new and happy submission.
  </p>

  <p>
But the seventh self remained watching and gazing at nothingness, which is behind all things.
  </p>

<div class="poem">
  <h2 class="title">A Visit From Wisdom</h2>

  <p>
In the stillness of night Wisdom came and stood<br>
By my bed. She gazed upon me like a tender mother<br>
And wiped away my tears, and said: "I have heard<br>
The cry of your spirit and I am come to comfort it.<br>
Open your heart to me and I shall fill it with light.<br>
Ask of me and I shall show you the way of truth."
  </p>

  <p>
And I said: "Who am I, Wisdom, and how came<br>
I to this frightening place? What manner of things<br>
Are these mighty hopes and these many books and<br>
Strange patterns? What are these thoughts that pass<br>
As doves in flight? And these words composed by<br>
Desire and sung by delight, what are they? What are<br>
These conclusions, grievous and joyous, that embrace<br>
My spirit and envelop my heart? And those<br>
Eyes which look at me seeing into my depths and<br>
Fleeing from my sorrows? And those voices mourning<br>
My days and chanting my littleness, what are they?
  </p>

  <p>
"What is this youth that plays with my desires<br>
And mocks at my longings, forgetful of yesterday's<br>
Deeds, rejoicing in paltry things of the moment,<br>
Scornful of the morrow's coming?
  </p>

  <p>
"What is this world that leads me whither I know<br>
Not, standing with me in despising? And this earth<br>
That opens wide its mouth to swallow bodies and<br>
Lets evil things to dwell on its breast? What is this<br>
Creature that is satisfied with the love of fortune,<br>
Whilst beyond its union is the pit? Who seeks Life's<br>
Kiss whilst Death does smite him, and brings the<br>
Pleasure of a minute with a year of repentance, and<br>
Gives himself to slumber the while dreams call him?<br>
What is he who flows with the rivers of folly to the<br>
Sea of darkness? O Wisdom, what manner of things<br>
Are these?"
  </p>

  <p>
And she answered, saying:<br>
"You would see, human creature, this world<br>
Through the eyes of a god. And you would seek to<br>
Know the secrets of the hereafter with the thinking<br>
Of men. Yet in truth is this the height of folly.
  </p>

  <p>
"Go you to the wild places and you shall find<br>
There the bee above the flowers and behold the eagle<br>
Swooping down on his prey. Go you into your neighbor's<br>
House and see then the child blinking at the<br>
Firelight and his mother busied at her household<br>
Tasks. Be you like the bee and spend not the days of<br>
Spring looking on the eagle's doing. Be as the child<br>
And rejoice in the firelight and heed not your<br>
Mother's affairs. All that you see with your eyes was<br>
And is for your sake.
  </p>

  <p>
"The many books and the strange patterns and<br>
Beautiful thoughts are the shades of those spirits<br>
That came ere you were come. The words that you<br>
Do weave are a bond between you and your brothers.<br>
The conclusions, grievous and joyous, are the<br>
Seeds that the past did scatter in the field of the<br>
Spirit to be reaped by the future. That youth who<br>
Plays with your desires is he who will open the door<br>
Of your heart to let enter the light. This earth with<br>
The ever open mouth is the savior of your spirit from<br>
The body's slavery. This world which walks with<br>
You is your heart; and your heart is all that you<br>
Think that world. This creature whom you see as<br>
Ignorant and small is the same who has come from<br>
God's side to learn pity through sadness, and knowledge<br>
By way of darkness."
  </p>

  <p>
Then Wisdom put her hand on my burning brow<br>
And said:<br>
"Go then forward and do not tarry, for before walks Perfection.<br>
Go, and have not fear of thorns on the path,<br>
For they deem naught lawful save corrupted blood."

  <h2 class="title">The Life Of Love XVI</h2>


  <h3 class="section">Spring</h3>
  <p>
Come, my beloved; let us walk amidst the knolls,<br>
For the snow is water, and Life is alive from its<br>
Slumber and is roaming the hills and valleys.<br>
Let us follow the footprints of Spring into the<br>
Distant fields, and mount the hilltops to draw<br>
Inspiration high above the cool green plains.
  </p>

  <p>
Dawn of Spring has unfolded her winter-kept garment<br>
And placed it on the peach and citrus trees; and<br>
They appear as brides in the ceremonial custom of<br>
the Night of Kedre.
  </p>

  <p>
The sprigs of grapevine embrace each other like<br>
Sweethearts, and the brooks burst out in dance<br>
Between the rocks, repeating the song of joy;<br>
And the flowers bud suddenly from the heart of<br>
Nature, like foam from the rich heart of the sea.
  </p>

  <p>
Come, my beloved; let us drink the last of Winter's<br>
Tears from the cupped lilies, and soothe our spirits<br>
With the shower of notes from the birds, and wander<br>
In exhilaration through the intoxicating breeze.
  </p>

  <p>
Let us sit by that rock, where violets hide; let us<br>
Pursue their exchange of the sweetness of kisses.
  </p>


  <h3 class="section">Summer</h3>
  <p>
Let us go into the fields, my beloved, for the<br>
Time of harvest approaches, and the sun's eyes<br>
Are ripening the grain.<br>
Let us tend the fruit of the earth, as the<br>
Spirit nourishes the grains of Joy from the<br>
Seeds of Love, sowed deep in our hearts.<br>
Let us fill our bins with the products of<br>
Nature, as life fills so abundantly the<br>
Domain of our hearts with her endless bounty.<br>
Let us make the flowers our bed, and the<br>
Sky our blanket, and rest our heads together<br>
Upon pillows of soft hay.
  </p>

  <p>
Let us relax after the day's toil, and listen<br>
To the provoking murmur of the brook.
  </p>


  <h3 class="section">Autumn</h3>
  <p>
Let us go and gather grapes in the vineyard<br>
For the winepress, and keep the wine in old<br>
Vases, as the spirit keeps Knowledge of the<br>
Ages in eternal vessels.
  </p>

  <p>
Let us return to our dwelling, for the wind has<br>
Caused the yellow leaves to fall and shroud the<br>
Withering flowers that whisper elegy to Summer.<br>
Come home, my eternal sweetheart, for the birds<br>
Have made pilgrimage to warmth and lest the chilled<br>
Prairies suffering pangs of solitude. The jasmine<br>
And myrtle have no more tears.
  </p>

  <p>
Let us retreat, for the tired brook has<br>
Ceased its song; and the bubblesome springs<br>
Are drained of their copious weeping; and<br>
Their cautious old hills have stored away<br>
Their colorful garments.
  </p>

  <p>
Come, my beloved; Nature is justly weary<br>
And is bidding her enthusiasm farewell<br>
With quiet and contented melody.
  </p>


  <h3 class="section">Winter</h3>
  <p>
Come close to me, oh companion of my full life;<br>
Come close to me and let not Winter's touch<br>
Enter between us. Sit by me before the hearth,<br>
For fire is the only fruit of Winter.
  </p>

  <p>
Speak to me of the glory of your heart, for<br>
That is greater than the shrieking elements<br>
Beyond our door.<br>
Bind the door and seal the transoms, for the<br>
Angry countenance of the heaven depresses my<br>
Spirit, and the face of our snow-laden fields<br>
Makes my soul cry.
  </p>

  <p>
Feed the lamp with oil and let it not dim, and<br>
Place it by you, so I can read with tears what<br>
Your life with me has written upon your face.
  </p>

  <p>
Bring Autumn's wine. Let us drink and sing the<br>
Song of remembrance to Spring's carefree sowing,<br>
And Summer's watchful tending, and Autumn's<br>
Reward in harvest.
  </p>

  <p>
Come close to me, oh beloved of my soul; the<br>
Fire is cooling and fleeing under the ashes.<br>
Embrace me, for I fear loneliness; the lamp is<br>
Dim, and the wine which we pressed is closing<br>
Our eyes. Let us look upon each other before<br>
They are shut.<br>
Find me with your arms and embrace me; let<br>
Slumber then embrace our souls as one.<br>
Kiss me, my beloved, for Winter has stolen<br>
All but our moving lips.
  </p>

  <p>
You are close by me, My Forever.<br>
How deep and wide will be the ocean of Slumber,<br>
And how recent was the dawn!

  <h2 class="title">Where The Mind Is Without Fear</h2>

  <p>
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high<br>
Where knowledge is free<br>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br>
By narrow domestic walls
  </p>

  <p>
Where words come out from the depth of truth<br>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br>
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
  </p>

Where the mind is led forward by thee<br>
Into ever-widening thought and action<br>
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

  <h2 class="title">Unending Love</h2>

  <p>
I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…<br>
In life after life, in age after age, forever.<br>
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,<br>
That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,<br>
In life after life, in age after age, forever.
  </p>

  <p>
Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,<br>
Its ancient tale of being apart or together.<br>
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,<br>
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:<br>
You become an image of what is remembered forever.
  </p>

  <p>
You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.<br>
At the heart of time, love of one for another.<br>
We have played alongside millions of lovers, shared in the same<br>
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-<br>
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.
  </p>

  <p>
Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you<br>
The love of all man’s days both past and forever:<br>
Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.<br>
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –<br>
And the songs of every poet past and forever.

Freedom from fear is the freedom<br>

Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,<br>
breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning<br>
call of the future;
  </p>

  <p>
Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith<br>
you fasten yourself in night's stillness,<br>
mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;<br>
freedom from the anarchy of destiny<br>
whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,<br>
and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.
  </p>

  <p>
Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,<br>
where movements are started through brainless wires,<br>
repeated through mindless habits,<br>
where figures wait with patience and obedience for the<br>
master of show,<br>
to be stirred into a mimicry of life.

  <h2 class="title">One Day In Spring....</h2>

  <p>
One day in spring, a woman came<br>
In my lonely woods,<br>
In the lovely form of the Beloved.<br>
Came, to give to my songs, melodies,<br>
To give to my dreams, sweetness.<br>
Suddenly a wild wave<br>
Broke over my heart's shores<br>
And drowned all language.<br>
To my lips no name came,<br>
She stood beneath the tree, turned,<br>
Glanced at my face, made sad with pain,<br>
And with quick steps, came and sat by me.<br>
Taking my hands in hers, she said:<br>
'You do not know me, nor I you—<br>
I wonder how this could be?'<br>
I said:<br>
'We two shall build, a bridge for ever<br>
Between two beings, each to the other unknown,<br>
This eager wonder is at the heart of things.'
  </p>

  <p>
The cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart;<br>
The thread with which she binds me binds her too.<br>
Her have I sought everywhere,<br>
Her have I worshipped within me,<br>
Hidden in that worship she has sought me too.<br>
Crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart.<br>
She forgot to return, having lost her own.<br>
Her own charms play traitor to her,<br>
She spreads her net, knowing not<br>
Whether she will catch or be caught.

The song I came to sing<br>
remains unsung to this day.<br>
I have spent my days in stringing<br>
and in unstringing my instrument.

  <p>
The time has not come true,<br>
the words have not been rightly set;<br>
only there is the agony<br>
of wishing in my heart…..

  <p>
I have not seen his face,<br>
nor have I listened to his voice;<br>
only I have heard his gentle footsteps<br>
from the road before my house…..

But the lamp has not been lit<br>
and I cannot ask him into my house;<br>
I live in the hope of meeting with him;<br>
but this meeting is not yet.

  <h2 class="title">The Golden Boat</h2>

  <p>
Clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain.<br>
I sit on the river bank, sad and alone.<br>
The sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended,<br>
The river is swollen and fierce in its flow.<br>
As we cut the paddy it started to rain.
  </p>

  <p>
One small paddy-field, no one but me -<br>
Flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere.<br>
Trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink<br>
On a village painted on deep morning grey.<br>
On this side a paddy-field, no one but me.
  </p>

  <p>
Who is this, steering close to the shore<br>
Singing? I feel that she is someone I know.<br>
The sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead,<br>
Waves break helplessly against the boat each side.<br>
I watch and feel I have seen her face before.
  </p>

  <p>
Oh to what foreign land do you sail?<br>
Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while.<br>
Go where you want to, give where you care to,<br>
But come to the bank a moment, show your smile -<br>
Take away my golden paddy when you sail.
  </p>

  <p>
Take it, take as much as you can load.<br>
Is there more? No, none, I have put it aboard.<br>
My intense labour here by the river -<br>
I have parted with it all, layer upon layer;<br>
Now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard.
  </p>

  <p>
No room, no room, the boat is too small.<br>
Loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full.<br>
Across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro,<br>
On the bare river-bank, I remain alone -<br>
What had has gone: the golden boat took all.

If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it.<br>

and its head bent low with patience.
  </p>

  <p>
The morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish,<br>
and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky.
  </p>

  <p>
Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests,<br>

Thou knowest how to wait.
  </p>

  <p>
Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.
  </p>

  <p>
We have no time to lose,<br>
and having no time we must scramble for a chance.<br>
We are too poor to be late.
  </p>

  <p>
And thus it is that time goes by<br>
while I give it to every querulous man who claims it,<br>
and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.

At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut;<br>
but I find that yet there is time.

my sleep like a bubble.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I shall never hear again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their place, just that one word,<br>
Bound by the thin fabric of a little compassion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would even that have been too much for you to bear?
  </p>

  <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first awoke from sleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart fluttered with fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the time had been over.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rushed out of bed.<br>
The distant church clock chimed half past twelve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat waiting near the door of my room<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resting my head against it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facing the porch through which you would come out.
  </p>

  <p>
Even that tiniest of chances<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was snatched away by fate from hapless me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I fell asleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly before you left.<br>
Perhaps you cast a sidelong glance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At my reclining body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a broken boat left high and dry.<br>
Perhaps you walked away with care<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest you wake me up.<br>
Awaking with a start I knew at once<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That my vigil had been wasted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I realised, what was to go went away in a moment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was to stay behind stayed on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all time.
  </p>

  <p>
Silence everywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like that of a birds' nest bereft of birds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bough of a songless tree.<br>
With the lifeless light of the waning moon was now blended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pallor of dawn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading itself over the greyness of my empty life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked towards your bedroom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For no reason.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the door<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Burnt a smoky lantern covered with soot,<br>
The porch smelt of the smouldering wick.<br>
Over the abandoned bed the flaps of the rolled-up mosquito-net<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluttered a little in the breeze.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen in the sky outside through the window<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the morning star,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witness of all sleepless people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereft of hope.
  </p>

  <p>
Suddenly I found you had left behind by mistake<br>
Your gold-mounted ivory walking stick.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were time, I thought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might come back from the station to look for it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You had not seen me before going away.

Light, oh where is the light?<br>

There is the lamp but never a flicker of a flame—-is such thy fate, my heart?<br>
Ah, death were better by far for thee!

Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running<br>

the village where I live.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and<br>
know who I am.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and<br>
hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land<br>
in the night.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the<br>
little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down<br>
the air to race with my boats!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins<br>
their baskets full of dreams.

  <h2 class="title">The Home</h2>

  <p>
I paced alone on the road across the field while the sunset was<br>
hiding its last gold like a miser.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daylight sank deeper and deeper into the darkness, and the<br>
widowed land, whose harvest had been reaped, lay silent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a boy's shrill voice rose into the sky. He traversed<br>
the dark unseen, leaving the track of his song across the hush of<br>
the evening.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His village home lay there at the end of the waste land,<br>
beyond the sugar-cane field, hidden among the shadows of the banana<br>
and the slender areca palm, the coconut and the dark green jack-<br>
fruit trees.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped for a moment in my lonely way under the starlight,<br>
and saw spread before me the darkened earth surrounding with her<br>
arms countless homes furnished with cradles and beds, mother's<br>
hearts and evening lamps, and young lives glad with a gladness that<br>
knows nothing of its value for the world.

Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
His house is in the village though;<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
  </p>

  <p>
My little horse must think it queer<br>
To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
The darkest evening of the year.
  </p>

  <p>
He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
The only other sound's the sweep<br>
Of easy wind and downy flake.
  </p>

  <p>
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.<br>
But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep.

  <p>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,<br>
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the one less traveled by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that has made all the difference.

My Sorrow, when she's here with me,<br>
Thinks these dark days of autumn rain<br>
Are beautiful as days can be;<br>
She loves the bare, the withered tree;<br>
She walks the sodden pasture lane.
  </p>

  <p>
Her pleasure will not let me stay.<br>
She talks and I am fain to list:<br>
She's glad the birds are gone away,<br>
She's glad her simple worsted grey<br>
Is silver now with clinging mist.
  </p>

  <p>
The desolate, deserted trees,<br>
The faded earth, the heavy sky,<br>
The beauties she so truly sees,<br>
She thinks I have no eye for these,<br>
And vexes me for reason why.
  </p>

  <p>
Not yesterday I learned to know<br>
The love of bare November days<br>
Before the coming of the snow,<br>
But it were vain to tell her so,<br>
And they are better for her praise.

The way a crow<br>

  <p>
An ant on the tablecloth<br>
Ran into a dormant moth<br>
Of many times his size.<br>
He showed not the least surprise.<br>
His business wasn't with such.<br>
He gave it scarcely a touch,<br>
And was off on his duty run.<br>
Yet if he encountered one<br>
Of the hive's enquiry squad<br>
Whose work is to find out God<br>
And the nature of time and space,<br>
He would put him onto the case.<br>
Ants are a curious race;<br>
One crossing with hurried tread<br>
The body of one of their dead<br>
Isn't given a moment's arrest-<br>
Seems not even impressed.<br>
But he no doubt reports to any<br>
With whom he crosses antennae,<br>
And they no doubt report<br>
To the higher-up at court.<br>
Then word goes forth in Formic:<br>
"Death's come to Jerry McCormic,<br>
Our selfless forager Jerry.<br>
Will the special Janizary<br>
Whose office it is to bury<br>
The dead of the commissary<br>
Go bring him home to his people.<br>
Lay him in state on a sepal.<br>
Wrap him for shroud in a petal.<br>
Embalm him with ichor of nettle.<br>
This is the word of your Queen."<br>
And presently on the scene<br>
Appears a solemn mortician;<br>
And taking formal position,<br>
With feelers calmly atwiddle,<br>
Seizes the dead by the middle,<br>
And heaving him high in air,<br>
Carries him out of there.<br>
No one stands round to stare.<br>
It is nobody else's affair<br>
It couldn't be called ungentle<br>
But how thoroughly departmental

What would it take my standing there for,<br>
Holding open a restive door,<br>
Looking down hill to a frothy shore?<br>
Summer was past and the day was past.<br>
Sombre clouds in the west were massed.<br>
Out on the porch's sagging floor,<br>
Leaves got up in a coil and hissed,<br>
Blindly struck at my knee and missed.<br>
Something sinister in the tone<br>
Told me my secret must be known:<br>
Word I was in the house alone<br>
Somehow must have gotten abroad,<br>
Word I was in my life alone,<br>
Word I had no one left but God.

I have walked out in rain — and back in rain.<br>
I have outwalked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.<br>
I have passed by the watchman on his beat<br>
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet<br>
When far away an interrupted cry<br>
Came over houses from another street,
  </p>

  <p>
But not to call me back or say good-bye;<br>
And further still at an unearthly height,<br>
A luminary clock against the sky
  </p>

  <p>
Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.<br>
I have been one acquainted with the night.<br>

  <p>
God made a beauteous garden<br>
With lovely flowers strown,<br>
But one straight, narrow pathway<br>
That was not overgrown.<br>
And to this beauteous garden<br>
He brought mankind to live,<br>
And said: "To you, my children,<br>
These lovely flowers I give.<br>
Prune ye my vines and fig trees,<br>
With care my flowerets tend,<br>
But keep the pathway open<br>
Your home is at the end."
  </p>

  <p>
Then came another master,<br>
Who did not love mankind,<br>
And planted on the pathway<br>
Gold flowers for them to find.<br>
And mankind saw the bright flowers,<br>
That, glitt'ring in the sun,<br>
Quite hid the thorns of av'rice<br>
That poison blood and bone;<br>
And far off many wandered,<br>
And when life's night came on,<br>
They still were seeking gold flowers,<br>
Lost, helpless and alone.
  </p>

  <p>
O, cease to heed the glamour<br>
That blinds your foolish eyes,<br>
Look upward to the glitter<br>
Of stars in God's clear skies.<br>
Their ways are pure and harmless<br>
And will not lead astray,<br>
Bid aid your erring footsteps<br>
To keep the narrow way.<br>
And when the sun shines brightly<br>
Tend flowers that God has given<br>
And keep the pathway open<br>
That leads you on to heaven.

  <p>
There is a singer everyone has heard,<br>
Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,<br>
Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.<br>
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers<br>
Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.<br>
He says the early petal-fall is past<br>
When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers<br>
On sunny days a moment overcast;<br>
And comes that other fall we name the fall.<br>
He says the highway dust is over all.<br>
The bird would cease and be as other birds<br>
But that he knows in singing not to sing.<br>
The question that he frames in all but words<br>
Is what to make of a diminished thing.

  <h2 class="title">Mending Wall</h2>

  <p>
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br>
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,<br>
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;<br>
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.<br>
The work of hunters is another thing:<br>
I have come after them and made repair<br>
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,<br>
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,<br>
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,<br>
No one has seen them made or heard them made,<br>
But at spring mending-time we find them there.<br>
I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;<br>
And on a day we meet to walk the line<br>
And set the wall between us once again.<br>
We keep the wall between us as we go.<br>
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.<br>
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls<br>
We have to use a spell to make them balance:<br>
"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!"<br>
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.<br>
Oh, just another kind of out-door game,<br>
One on a side. It comes to little more:<br>
There where it is we do not need the wall:<br>
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.<br>
My apple trees will never get across<br>
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.<br>
He only says, "Good fences make good neighbors."<br>
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder<br>
If I could put a notion in his head:<br>
"Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it<br>
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.<br>
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know<br>
What I was walling in or walling out,<br>
And to whom I was like to give offence.<br>
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,<br>
That wants it down." I could say "Elves" to him,<br>
But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather<br>
He said it for himself. I see him there<br>
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top<br>
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.<br>
He moves in darkness as it seems to me,<br>
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.<br>
He will not go behind his father's saying,<br>
And he likes having thought of it so well<br>
He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors."

All the world's a stage,<br>

Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.<br>
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br>
And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br>
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,<br>
In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br>
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,<br>
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
That ends this strange eventful history,<br>

Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

All:<br>
Double, double toil and trouble;<br>
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

2nd Witch:<br>
Fillet of a fenny snake,<br>
In the cauldron boil and bake;<br>
Eye of newt and toe of frog,<br>
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,<br>
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,<br>
Lizard's leg and howlet's wing.<br>
For charm of powerful trouble,<br>
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

  <p>
All:<br>
Double, double toil and trouble;<br>
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
  </p>

  <p>
3rd Witch:<br>
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,<br>
Witch's mummy, maw and gulf<br>
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,<br>
Root of hemlock digg'd in the dark,<br>
Liver of blaspheming Jew;<br>
Gall of goat; and slips of yew<br>
Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse;<br>
Nose of Turk, and Tartar's lips;<br>
Finger of birth-strangled babe<br>
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,-<br>
Make the gruel thick and slab:<br>
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,<br>
For ingredients of our cauldron.
  </p>

  <p>
All:<br>
Double, double toil and trouble,<br>
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

2nd Witch:<br>
Cool it with a baboon's blood,<br>
Then the charm is firm and good.

Blow, blow, thou winter wind<br>
Thou art not so unkind<br>
As man's ingratitude;<br>
Thy tooth is not so keen,<br>
Because thou art not seen,<br>
Although thy breath be rude.

Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:<br>
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:<br>

Freeze, freeze thou bitter sky,<br>
That does not bite so nigh<br>
As benefits forgot:<br>
Though thou the waters warp,<br>
Thy sting is not so sharp<br>
As a friend remembered not.

  <p>
My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
Coral is far more red than her lips’ red:<br>
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
  </p>

  <p>
I have seen roses damask’d, red and white,<br>
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>
And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
  </p>

  <p>
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br>
That music hath a far more pleasing sound:<br>
I grant I never saw a goddess go,<br>
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
  </p>

  <p>
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br>
As any she belied with false compare.

  <h2 class="title">To be, or not to be: that is the question</h2>

  <p>
To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,<br>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause—there's the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life.
  </p>

  <p>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,<br>
The insolence of office, and the spurns<br>
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
When he himself might his quietus make<br>
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,<br>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
But that the dread of something after death,<br>
The undiscovered country from whose bourn<br>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,<br>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
Than fly to others that we know not of?
  </p>

  <p>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,<br>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br>
With this regard their currents turn awry<br>
And lose the name of action.

  <p>
The quality of mercy is not strain'd.<br>
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br>
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:<br>
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes.<br>
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes<br>
The throned monarch better than his crown.<br>
His scepter shows the force of temporal power,<br>
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br>
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br>
But mercy is above this sceptered sway;<br>
It is enthroned in the heart of kings;<br>
It is an attribute to God himself;<br>
And earthly power doth then show likest God's<br>
When mercy seasons justice.

  <h2 class="title">The Naming of Cats</h2>

  <p>
The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,<br>
It isn't just one of your holiday games;<br>
You may think at first I'm as mad as a hatter<br>
When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.<br>
First of all, there's the name that the family use daily,<br>
Such as Peter, Augustus, Alonzo or James,<br>
Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—<br>
All of them sensible everyday names.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,<br>
Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:<br>
Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—<br>
But all of them sensible everyday names.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
But I tell you, a cat needs a name that's particular,<br>
A name that's peculiar, and more dignified,<br>
Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,<br>
Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?<br>
Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,<br>
Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat,<br>
Such as Bombalurina, or else Jellylorum—<br>
Names that never belong to more than one cat.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
But above and beyond there's still one name left over,<br>
And that is the name that you never will guess;<br>
The name that no human research can discover—<br>
But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.<br>
  </p>

  <p>
When you notice a cat in profound meditation,<br>
The reason, I tell you, is always the same:<br>
His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation<br>
Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:<br>
His ineffable effable<br>
Effanineffable<br>
Deep and inscrutable singular Name.

  <h2 class="title">The Hollow Men</h2>
  <p><em>Mistah Kurtz—he dead<br>
  A penny for the Old Guy</em></p>

  <h3>I</h3>
  <p>
  We are the hollow men<br>
  We are the stuffed men<br>
  Leaning together<br>
  Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!<br>
  Our dried voices, when<br>
  We whisper together<br>
  Are quiet and meaningless<br>
  As wind in dry grass<br>
  Or rats' feet over broken glass<br>
  In our dry cellar<br>
  <br>
  Shape without form, shade without colour,<br>
  Paralysed force, gesture without motion;<br>
  <br>
  Those who have crossed<br>
  With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom<br>
  Remember us—if at all—not as lost<br>
  Violent souls, but only<br>
  As the hollow men<br>
  The stuffed men.

  <h3>II</h3>
  <p>
  Eyes I dare not meet in dreams<br>
  In death's dream kingdom<br>
  These do not appear:<br>
  There, the eyes are<br>
  Sunlight on a broken column<br>
  There, is a tree swinging<br>
  And voices are<br>
  In the wind's singing<br>
  More distant and more solemn<br>
  Than a fading star.<br>
  <br>
  Let me be no nearer<br>
  In death's dream kingdom<br>
  Let me also wear<br>
  Such deliberate disguises<br>
  Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves<br>
  In a field<br>
  Behaving as the wind behaves<br>
  No nearer—<br>
  <br>
  Not that final meeting<br>
  In the twilight kingdom
  </p>

  <h3>III</h3>
  <p>
  This is the dead land<br>
  This is cactus land<br>
  Here the stone images<br>
  Are raised, here they receive<br>
  The supplication of a dead man's hand<br>
  Under the twinkle of a fading star.<br>
  <br>
  Is it like this<br>
  In death's other kingdom<br>
  Waking alone<br>
  At the hour when we are<br>
  Trembling with tenderness<br>
  Lips that would kiss<br>
  Form prayers to broken stone.
  </p>

  <h3>IV</h3>
  <p>
  The eyes are not here<br>
  There are no eyes here<br>
  In this valley of dying stars<br>
  In this hollow valley<br>
  This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms<br>
  <br>
  In this last of meeting places<br>
  We grope together<br>
  And avoid speech<br>
  Gathered on this beach of the tumid river<br>
  <br>
  Sightless, unless<br>
  The eyes reappear<br>
  As the perpetual star<br>
  Multifoliate rose<br>
  Of death's twilight kingdom<br>
  The hope only<br>
  Of empty men.
  </p>

  <h3>V</h3>
  <p>
  Here we go round the prickly pear<br>
  Prickly pear prickly pear<br>
  Here we go round the prickly pear<br>
  At five o'clock in the morning.<br>
  <br>
  Between the idea<br>
  And the reality<br>
  Between the motion<br>
  And the act<br>
  Falls the Shadow<br>
  <span style="display:block;text-align:center;">For Thine is the Kingdom</span><br>

  <p>
  Macavity's a Mystery Cat: he's called the Hidden Paw—<br>
  For he's the master criminal who can defy the Law.<br>
  He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair:<br>
  For when they reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there!
  </p>

  <p>
  Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,<br>
  He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.<br>
  His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,<br>
  And when you reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there!<br>
  You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air—<br>
  But I tell you once and once again, Macavity's not there!
  </p>

  <p>
  Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin;<br>
  You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.<br>
  His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed;<br>
  His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.<br>
  He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake;<br>
  And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake.
  </p>

  <p>
  Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,<br>
  For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.<br>
  You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square—<br>
  But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there!
  </p>

  <p>
  He's outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)<br>
  And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard's<br>
  And when the larder's looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,<br>
  Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke's been stifled,<br>
  Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair<br>
  Ay, there's the wonder of the thing! Macavity's not there!
  </p>

  <p>
  And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty's gone astray,<br>
  Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,<br>
  There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair—<br>
  But it's useless to investigate—Macavity's not there!<br>
  And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:<br>
  It must have been Macavity!'—but he's a mile away.<br>
  You'll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumb;<br>
  Or engaged in doing complicated long division sums.
  </p>

  <p>
  Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,<br>
  There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.<br>
  He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare:<br>
  At whatever time the deed took place—MACAVITY WASN'T THERE!<br>
  And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known<br>
  (I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)<br>
  Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time<br>
  Just controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!

  <h2 class="title">The Journey of the Magi</h2>

  <p>
  “A cold coming we had of it,<br>
  Just the worst time of the year<br>
  For a journey, and such a long journey:<br>
  The ways deep and the weather sharp,<br>
  The very dead of winter.”<br>
  And the camels galled, sorefooted, refractory,<br>
  Lying down in the melting snow.<br>
  There were times we regretted<br>
  The summer palaces on slopes, the terraces,<br>
  And the silken girls bringing sherbet.<br>
  Then the camel men cursing and grumbling<br>
  And running away, and wanting their liquor and women,<br>
  And the night-fires going out, and the lack of shelters,<br>
  And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly<br>
  And the villages dirty and charging high prices:<br>
  A hard time we had of it.<br>
  At the end we preferred to travel all night,<br>
  Sleeping in snatches,<br>
  With the voices singing in our ears, saying<br>
  That this was all folly.
  </p>

  <p>
  Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley,<br>
  Wet, below the snow line, smelling of vegetation;<br>
  With a running stream and a water-mill beating the darkness,<br>
  And three trees on the low sky,<br>
  And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.<br>
  Then we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel,<br>
  Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver,<br>
  And feet kicking the empty wine-skins.<br>
  But there was no information, and so we continued<br>
  And arriving at evening, not a moment too soon<br>
  Finding the place; it was (you might say) satisfactory.
  </p>

  <p>
  All this was a long time ago, I remember,<br>
  And I would do it again, but set down<br>
  This set down<br>
  This: were we led all that way for<br>
  Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly<br>
  We had evidence and no doubt. I had seen birth and death,<br>
  But had thought they were different; this Birth was<br>
  Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.<br>
  We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,<br>
  But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,<br>
  With an alien people clutching their gods.<br>
  I should be glad of another death.

  You have the scene arrange itself—as it will seem to do—<br>

  Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,<br>
  An atmosphere of Juliet’s tomb<br>
  Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.<br>
  We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole<br>
  Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.<br>
  “So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul<br>

  “You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,<br>
  And how, how rare and strange it is, to find<br>
  In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,<br>
  (For indeed I do not love it… you knew? you are not blind!<br>
  How keen you are!)<br>
  To find a friend who has these qualities,<br>
  Who has, and gives<br>
  Those qualities upon which friendship lives.<br>
  How much it means that I say this to you—<br>
  Without these friendships—life, what cauchemar!”<br>
  Among the windings of the violins<br>
  And the ariettes<br>
  Of cracked cornets<br>
  Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins<br>
  Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,<br>
  Capricious monotone<br>
  That is at least one definite “false note.”<br>
  —Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,<br>
  Admire the monuments<br>
  Discuss the late events,<br>
  Correct our watches by the public clocks.<br>
  Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.

  Now that lilacs are in bloom<br>
  She has a bowl of lilacs in her room<br>
  And twists one in her fingers while she talks.<br>
  “Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know<br>
  What life is, you should hold it in your hands”;<br>
  (Slowly (twisting the lilac stalks)<br>
  “You let it flow from you, you let it flow,<br>
  And youth is cruel, and has no remorse<br>
  And smiles at situations which it cannot see.”<br>
  I smile, of course,<br>
  And go on drinking tea.<br>
  “Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall<br>
  My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,<br>
  I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world<br>
  To be wonderful and youthful, after all.”
  </p>

  <p>
  The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune<br>
  Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:<br>
  “I am always sure that you understand<br>
  My feelings, always sure that you feel,<br>
  Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.<br>
  You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles’ heel.<br>
  You will go on, and when you have prevailed<br>
  You can say: at this point many a one has failed.<br><br>

  But what have I, but what have I, my friend,<br>
  To give you, what can you receive from me?<br>
  Only the friendship and the sympathy<br>
  Of one about to reach her journey’s end.<br><br>

  I shall sit here, serving tea to friends….”
  </p>

  <p>
  I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends<br>
  For what she has said to me?<br>
  You will see me any morning in the park<br>
  Reading the comics and the sporting page.<br>
  Particularly I remark An English countess goes upon the stage.<br>
  A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,<br>
  Another bank defaulter has confessed.<br>
  I keep my countenance, I remain self‑possessed<br>
  Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired<br>
  Reiterates some worn‑out common song<br>
  With the smell of hyacinths across the garden<br>
  Recalling things that other people have desired.<br>
  Are these ideas right or wrong?
  </p>

  <p>
  The October night comes down; returning as before<br>
  Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease<br>
  I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door<br>
  And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.<br><br>

  “And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?<br>
  But that’s a useless question.<br>
  You hardly know when you are coming back,<br>
  You will find so much to learn.”<br>
  My smile falls heavily among the bric‑à‑brac.<br><br>

  “Perhaps you can write to me.”<br>
  My self‑possession flares up for a second;<br>
  This is as I had reckoned.
  </p>

  <p>
  “I have been wondering frequently of late<br>
  (But our beginnings never know our ends!)<br>
  Why we have not developed into friends.”<br>
  I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark<br>
  Suddenly, his expression in a glass.<br>
  My self‑possession gutters; we are really in the dark.<br><br>

  “For everybody said so, all our friends,<br>
  They all were sure our feelings would relate<br>
  So closely! I myself can hardly understand.<br>
  We must leave it now to fate.<br>
  You will write, at any rate.<br>
  Perhaps it is not too late.<br>
  I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.”
  </p>

  <p>
  And I must borrow every changing shape<br>
  To find expression… dance, dance<br>
  Like a dancing bear,<br>
  Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.<br>
  Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance—<br><br>

  Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,<br>
  Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;<br>
  Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand<br>
  With the smoke coming down above the housetops;<br>
  Doubtful, for quite a while<br>
  Not knowing what to feel or if I understand<br>
  Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon…<br>
  Would she not have the advantage, after all?<br>
  This music is successful with a “dying fall”<br>
  Now that we talk of dying—<br>
  And should I have the right to smile?

  <h2 class="title">Morning At The Window</h2>

  <p>
  They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,<br>
  And along the trampled edges of the street<br>
  I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids<br>
  Sprouting despondently at area gates.<br>
  The brown waves of fog toss up to me<br>
  Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,<br>
  And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts<br>
  An aimless smile that hovers in the air<br>
  And vanishes along the level of the roofs.

  <h3>I</h3>
  <p>
  Time present and time past<br>
  Are both perhaps present in time future,<br>
  And time future contained in time past.<br>
  If all time is eternally present<br>
  All time is unredeemable.<br>
  What might have been is an abstraction<br>
  Remaining a perpetual possibility<br>
  Only in a world of speculation.<br>
  What might have been and what has been<br>
  Point to one end, which is always present.<br>
  Footfalls echo in the memory<br>
  Down the passage which we did not take<br>
  Towards the door we never opened<br>
  Into the rose-garden. My words echo<br>
  Thus, in your mind.<br>
  But to what purpose<br>
  Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves<br>
  I do not know.<br>
  Other echoes<br>
  Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?<br>
  Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,<br>
  Round the corner. Through the first gate,<br>
  Into our first world, shall we follow<br>
  The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.<br>
  There they were, dignified, invisible,<br>
  Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,<br>
  In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,<br>
  And the bird called, in response to<br>
  The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,<br>
  And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses<br>
  Had the look of flowers that are looked at.<br>
  There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.<br>
  So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,<br>
  Along the empty alley, into the box circle,<br>
  To look down into the drained pool.<br>
  Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,<br>
  And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,<br>
  And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,<br>
  The surface glittered out of heart of light,<br>
  And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.<br>
  Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.<br>
  Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,<br>
  Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.<br>
  Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind<br>
  Cannot bear very much reality.<br>
  Time past and time future<br>
  What might have been and what has been<br>
  Point to one end, which is always present.

  Garlic and sapphires in the mud<br>
  Clot the bedded axle-tree.<br>
  The trilling wire in the blood<br>
  Sings below inveterate scars<br>
  Appeasing long forgotten wars.<br>
  The dance along the artery<br>
  The circulation of the lymph<br>
  Are figured in the drift of stars<br>
  Ascend to summer in the tree<br>
  We move above the moving tree<br>
  In light upon the figured leaf<br>
  And hear upon the sodden floor<br>
  Below, the boarhound and the boar<br>
  Pursue their pattern as before<br>
  But reconciled among the stars.<br><br>

  At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;<br>
  Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,<br>
  But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,<br>
  Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,<br>
  Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,<br>
  There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.<br>
  I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.<br>
  And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.<br>
  The inner freedom from the practical desire,<br>
  The release from action and suffering, release from the inner<br>
  And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded<br>
  By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,<br>
  Erhebung without motion, concentration<br>
  Without elimination, both a new world<br>
  And the old made explicit, understood<br>
  In the completion of its partial ecstasy,<br>
  The resolution of its partial horror.<br>
  Yet the enchainment of past and future<br>
  Woven in the weakness of the changing body,<br>
  Protects mankind from heaven and damnation<br>
  Which flesh cannot endure.<br>
  Time past and time future<br>
  Allow but a little consciousness.<br>
  To be conscious is not to be in time<br>
  But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,<br>
  The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,<br>
  The moment in the draughty church at smokefall<br>
  Be remembered; involved with past and future.<br>
  Only through time time is conquered.

  Here is a place of disaffection<br>
  Time before and time after<br>
  In a dim light: neither daylight<br>
  Investing form with lucid stillness<br>
  Turning shadow into transient beauty<br>
  With slow rotation suggesting permanence<br>
  Nor darkness to purify the soul<br>
  Emptying the sensual with deprivation<br>
  Cleansing affection from the temporal.<br>
  Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker<br>
  Over the strained time-ridden faces<br>
  Distracted from distraction by distraction<br>
  Filled with fancies and empty of meaning<br>
  Tumid apathy with no concentration<br>
  Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind<br>
  That blows before and after time,<br>
  Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs<br>
  Time before and time after.<br>
  Eructation of unhealthy souls<br>
  Into the faded air, the torpid<br>
  Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,<br>
  Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,<br>
  Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here<br>
  Not here the darkness, in this twittering world.<br><br>

  Descend lower, descend only<br>
  Into the world of perpetual solitude,<br>
  World not world, but that which is not world,<br>
  Internal darkness, deprivation<br>
  And destitution of all property,<br>
  Desiccation of the world of sense,<br>
  Evacuation of the world of fancy,<br>
  Inoperancy of the world of spirit;<br>
  This is the one way, and the other<br>
  Is the same, not in movement<br>
  But abstention from movement; while the world moves<br>
  In appetency, on its metalled ways<br>
  Of time past and time future.

  Time and the bell have buried the day,<br>
  The black cloud carries the sun away.<br>
  Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis<br>
  Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray<br>
  Clutch and cling?<br><br>

  Chill<br>
  Fingers of yew be curled<br>
  Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing<br>
  Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still<br>
  At the still point of the turning world.

  <p>
  Words move, music moves<br>
  Only in time; but that which is only living<br>
  Can only die. Words, after speech, reach<br>
  Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,<br>
  Can words or music reach<br>
  The stillness, as a Chinese jar still<br>
  Moves perpetually in its stillness.<br>
  Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,<br>
  Not that only, but the co-existence,<br>
  Or say that the end precedes the beginning,<br>
  And the end and the beginning were always there<br>
  Before the beginning and after the end.<br>
  And all is always now. Words strain,<br>
  Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,<br>
  Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,<br>
  Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,<br>
  Will not stay still. Shrieking voices<br>
  Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,<br>
  Always assail them. The Word in the desert<br>
  Is most attacked by voices of temptation,<br>
  The crying shadow in the funeral dance,<br>
  The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.<br><br>

  The detail of the pattern is movement,<br>
  As in the figure of the ten stairs.<br>
  Desire itself is movement<br>
  Not in itself desirable;<br>
  Love is itself unmoving,<br>
  Only the cause and end of movement,<br>
  Timeless, and undesiring<br>
  Except in the aspect of time<br>
  Caught in the form of limitation<br>
  Between un-being and being.<br>
  Sudden in a shaft of sunlight<br>
  Even while the dust moves<br>
  There rises the hidden laughter<br>
  Of children in the foliage<br>
  Quick now, here, now, always—<br>
  Ridiculous the waste sad time<br>
  Stretching before and after.

  As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her<br>
  laughter and being part of it, until her teeth were<br>
  only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill. I<br>
  was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary<br>
  recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her<br>
  throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An<br>
  elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly<br>
  spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty<br>
  green iron table, saying: "If the lady and gentleman<br>
  wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and<br>
  gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden…" I<br>
  decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be<br>
  stopped, some of the fragments of the afternoon might<br>
  be collected, and I concentrated my attention with<br>
  careful subtlety to this end.

  <h2 class="title">Of The Awful Battle Of The Pekes And The Pollicles</h2>
  <p>
    TOGETHER WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PARTICIPATION<br>
    OF THE PUGS AND THE POMS, AND THE INTERVENTION OF THE GREAT RUMPUSCAT
  </p>
  <p>
    The Pekes and the Pollicles, everyone knows,<br>
    Are proud and implacable passionate foes;<br>
    It is always the same, wherever one goes.<br>
    And the Pugs and the Poms, although most people say<br>
    That they do not like fighting, will often display<br>
    Every symptom of wanting to join in the fray.<br>
    And they<br>
    Bark bark bark bark<br>
    Bark bark BARK BARK<br>
    Until you can hear them all over the Park.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now on the occasion of which I shall speak<br>
    Almost nothing had happened for nearly a week<br>
    (And that's a long time for a Pol or a Peke).<br>
    The big Police Dog was away from his beat -<br>
    I don't know the reason, but most people think<br>
    He'd slipped into the Bricklayer's Arms for a drink -<br>
    And no one at all was about on the street<br>
    When a Peke and a Pollicle happened to meet.<br>
    They did not advance, or exactly retreat,<br>
    But they glared at each other and scraped their hind feet,<br>
    And started to<br>
    Bark bark bark bark<br>
    Bark bark BARK BARK<br>
    Until you could hear them all over the Park.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the Peke, although people may say what they please,<br>
    Is no British Dog, but a Heathen Chinese.<br>
    And so all the Pekes, when they heard the uproar,<br>
    Some came to the window, some came to the door;<br>
    There were surely a doyen, more likely a score.<br>
    And together they started to grumble and wheeye<br>
    In their huffery-snuffery Heathen Chinese.<br>
    But a terrible din is what Pollicles like,<br>
    for your Pollicle Dog is a dour Yorkshire tyke,<br>
    And his braw Scottish cousins are snappers and biters,<br>
    And every dog-jack of them notable fighters;<br>
    And so they stepped out, with their pipers in order,<br>
    Playing When the Blue Bonnets Came Over the Border.<br>
    Then the Pugs and the Poms held no longer aloof,<br>
    But some from the balcony, some from the roof,<br>
    Joined in<br>
    To the din<br>
    With a<br>
    Bark bark bark bark<br>
    Bark bark BARK BARK<br>
    Until you could hear them all over the Park.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now when these bold heroes together assembled,<br>
    The traffic all stopped, and the Underground trembled,<br>
    And some of the neighbours were so much afraid<br>
    That they started to ring up the Fire Brigade.<br>
    When suddenly, up from a small basement flat,<br>
    Why who should stalk out but the GREAT RUMPUSCAT.<br>
    His eyes were like fireballs fearfully blazing,<br>
    He gave a great yawn, and his jaws were amazing;<br>
    And when he looked out through the bars of the area,<br>
    You never saw anything fiercer or hairier.<br>
    And what with the glare of his eyes and his yawning,<br>
    The Pekes and the Pollicles quickly took warning.<br>
    He looked at the sky and he gave a great leap -<br>
    And they every last one of them scattered like sheep.
  </p>
  <p>
    And when the Police Dog returned to his beat,<br>
    There wasn't a single one left in the street.

  Because I do not hope<br>
  Because I do not hope to turn<br>

  Why should I mourn<br>

  Because I do not think<br>
  Because I know I shall not know<br>

  Because I cannot drink<br>

  Because I know that time is always time<br>

  Because I cannot hope to turn again<br>

  Because I do not hope to turn again<br>
  Let these words answer<br>
  For what is done, not to be done again<br>
  May the judgement not be too heavy upon us<br><br>

  Because these wings are no longer wings to fly<br>
  But merely vans to beat the air<br>
  The air which is now thoroughly small and dry<br>
  Smaller and dryer than the will<br>
  Teach us to care and not to care Teach us to sit still.<br><br>

  Pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death<br>
  Pray for us now and at the hour of our death.

  Lady, three white leopards sat under a juniper-tree<br>
  In the cool of the day, having fed to sateity<br>
  On my legs my heart my liver and that which had been contained<br>
  In the hollow round of my skull. And God said<br>
  Shall these bones live? shall these<br>
  Bones live? And that which had been contained<br>
  In the bones (which were already dry) said chirping:<br>
  Because of the goodness of this Lady<br>
  And because of her loveliness, and because<br>
  She honours the Virgin in meditation,<br>
  We shine with brightness. And I who am here dissembled<br>
  Proffer my deeds to oblivion, and my love<br>
  To the posterity of the desert and the fruit of the gourd.<br>
  It is this which recovers<br>
  My guts the strings of my eyes and the indigestible portions<br>
  Which the leopards reject. The Lady is withdrawn<br>
  In a white gown, to contemplation, in a white gown.<br>
  Let the whiteness of bones atone to forgetfulness.<br>
  There is no life in them. As I am forgotten<br>
  And would be forgotten, so I would forget<br>
  Thus devoted, concentrated in purpose. And God said<br>
  Prophesy to the wind, to the wind only for only<br>
  The wind will listen. And the bones sang chirping<br>
  With the burden of the grasshopper, saying<br><br>

  Lady of silences<br>
  Calm and distressed<br>
  Torn and most whole<br>
  Rose of memory<br>
  Rose of forgetfulness<br>
  Exhausted and life-giving<br>
  Worried reposeful<br>
  The single Rose<br>
  Is now the Garden<br>
  Where all loves end<br>
  Terminate torment<br>
  Of love unsatisfied<br>
  The greater torment<br>
  Of love satisfied<br>
  End of the endless<br>
  Journey to no end<br>
  Conclusion of all that<br>
  Is inconclusible<br>
  Speech without word and<br>
  Word of no speech<br>
  Grace to the Mother<br>
  For the Garden<br>
  Where all love ends.<br><br>

  Under a juniper-tree the bones sang, scattered and shining<br>
  We are glad to be scattered, we did little good to each other,<br>
  Under a tree in the cool of day, with the blessing of sand,<br>
  Forgetting themselves and each other, united<br>
  In the quiet of the desert. This is the land which ye<br>
  Shall divide by lot. And neither division nor unity<br>
  Matters. This is the land. We have our inheritance.

  At the first turning of the second stair<br>
  I turned and saw below<br>
  The same shape twisted on the banister<br>
  Under the vapour in the fetid air<br>
  Struggling with the devil of the stairs who wears<br>
  The deceitful face of hope and of despair.<br><br>

  At the second turning of the second stair<br>
  I left them twisting, turning below;<br>
  There were no more faces and the stair was dark,<br>
  Damp, jaggèd, like an old man's mouth drivelling, beyond repair,<br>
  Or the toothed gullet of an agèd shark.<br><br>

  At the first turning of the third stair<br>
  Was a slotted window bellied like the fig’s fruit<br>
  And beyond the hawthorn blossom and a pasture scene<br>
  The broadbacked figure drest in blue and green<br>
  Enchanted the maytime with an antique flute.<br>
  Blown hair is sweet, brown hair over the mouth blown,<br>
  Lilac and brown hair;<br>
  Distraction, music of the flute, stops and steps of the mind<br>
  Over the third stair,<br>

  Climbing the third stair.<br><br>

  If the lost word is lost, if the spent word is spent<br>
  If the unheard, unspoken<br>
  Word is unspoken, unheard;<br>
  Still is the unspoken word, the Word unheard,<br>
  The Word without a word, the Word within<br>
  The world and for the world;<br>
  And the light shone in darkness and<br>
  Against the Word the unstilled world still whirled<br>
  About the centre of the silent Word.<br><br>

  O my people, what have I done unto thee.<br><br>

  Where shall the word be found, where will the word<br>
  Resound? Not here, there is not enough silence<br>
  Not on the sea or on the islands, not<br>
  On the mainland, in the desert or the rain land,<br>
  For those who walk in darkness<br>
  Both in the day time and in the night time<br>
  The right time and the right place are not here<br>
  No place of grace for those who avoid the face<br>
  No time to rejoice for those who walk among noise and deny the voice<br><br>

  Will the veiled sister pray for<br>
  Those who walk in darkness, who chose thee and oppose thee,<br>
  Those who are torn on the horn between season and season, time and time, between<br>
  Hour and hour, word and word, power and power, those who wait<br>
  In darkness? Will the veiled sister pray<br>
  For children at the gate<br>
  Who will not go away and cannot pray:<br>
  Pray for those who chose and oppose<br><br>

  O my people, what have I done unto thee.<br><br>

  Will the veiled sister between the slender<br>
  Yew trees pray for those who offend her<br>
  And are terrified and cannot surrender<br>
  And affirm before the world and deny between the rocks<br>
  In the last desert before the last blue rocks<br>
  The desert in the garden the garden in the desert<br>
  Of drouth, spitting from the mouth the withered apple-seed.<br><br>

  O my people.

  Although I do not hope to turn again<br>
  Although I do not hope<br>
  Although I do not hope to turn<br><br>

  Wavering between the profit and the loss<br>
  In this brief transit where the dreams cross<br>
  The dreamcrossed twilight between birth and dying<br>
  (Bless me father) though I do not wish to wish these things<br>
  From the wide window towards the granite shore<br>
  The white sails still fly seaward, seaward flying<br>
  Unbroken wings<br><br>

  And the lost heart stiffens and rejoices<br>
  In the lost lilac and the lost sea voices<br>
  And the weak spirit quickens to rebel<br>
  For the bent golden-rod and the lost sea smell<br>
  Quickens to recover<br>
  The cry of quail and the whirling plover<br>
  And the blind eye creates<br>
  The empty forms between the ivory gates<br>
  And smell renews the salt savour of the sandy earth<br><br>

  This is the time of tension between dying and birth<br>
  The place of solitude where three dreams cross<br>
  Between blue rocks<br>
  But when the voices shaken from the yew-tree drift away<br>
  Let the other yew be shaken and reply.<br><br>

  Blessèd sister, holy mother, spirit of the fountain, spirit of the garden,<br>
  Suffer us not to mock ourselves with falsehood<br>
  Teach us to care and not to care<br>
  Teach us to sit still<br>
  Even among these rocks,<br>
  Our peace in His will<br>
  And even among these rocks<br>
  Sister, mother<br>
  And spirit of the river, spirit of the sea,<br>
  Suffer me not to be separated<br><br>

  And let my cry come unto Thee.

  <h2 class="title">Whispers of Immortality</h2>

  <p>
  Webster was much possessed by death<br>
  And saw the skull beneath the skin;<br>
  And breastless creatures under ground<br>
  Leaned backward with a lipless grin.<br><br>

  Daffodil bulbs instead of balls<br>
  Stared from the sockets of the eyes!<br>
  He knew that thought clings round dead limbs<br>
  Tightening its lusts and luxuries.<br><br>

  Donne, I suppose, was such another<br>
  Who found no substitute for sense;<br>
  To seize and clutch and penetrate,<br>
  Expert beyond experience,<br><br>

  He knew the anguish of the marrow<br>
  The ague of the skeleton;<br>
  No contact possible to flesh<br>
  Allayed the fever of the bone.<br><br>

  Grishkin is nice: her<br>
  Russian eye is underlined for emphasis;<br>
  Uncorseted, her friendly bust<br>
  Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.<br><br>

  The couched Brazilian jaguar<br>
  Compels the scampering marmoset<br>
  With subtle effluence of cat;<br>
  Grishkin has a maisonette;<br><br>

  The sleek Brazilian jaguar<br>
  Does not in its arboreal gloom<br>
  Distil so rank a feline smell<br>
  As Grishkin in a drawing-room.<br><br>

  And even the Abstract Entities<br>
  Circumambulate her charm;<br>
  But our lot crawls between dry ribs<br>
  To keep our metaphysics warm.

  <h2 class="title">Gerontion</h2>

  <p>
    Thou hast nor youth nor age<br>
    But as it were an after dinner sleep<br>
    Dreaming of both.<br><br>

    Here I am, an old man in a dry month,<br>
    Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.<br>
    I was neither at the hot gates<br>
    Nor fought in the warm rain<br>
    Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,<br>
    Bitten by flies, fought.<br>
    My house is a decayed house,<br>
    And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,<br>
    Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,<br>
    Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.<br>
    The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;<br>
    Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.<br>
    The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,<br>
    Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.<br>
    I an old man,<br>
    A dull head among windy spaces.<br><br>

    Signs are taken for wonders. "We would see a sign!"<br>
    The word within a word, unable to speak a word,<br>
    Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year<br>
    Came Christ the tiger<br><br>

    In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,<br>
    To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk<br>
    Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero<br>
    With caressing hands, at Limoges<br>
    Who walked all night in the next room;<br>
    By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;<br>
    By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room<br>
    Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp<br>
    Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles<br>
    Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,<br>
    An old man in a draughty house<br>
    Under a windy knob.<br><br>

    After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now<br>
    History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors<br>
    And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,<br>
    Guides us by vanities. Think now<br>
    She gives when our attention is distracted<br>
    And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions<br>
    That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late<br>
    What's not believed in, or if still believed,<br>
    In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon<br>
    Into weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with<br>
    Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think<br>
    Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices<br>
    Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues<br>
    Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.<br>
    These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.<br><br>

    The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last<br>
    We have not reached conclusion, when I<br>
    Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last<br>
    I have not made this show purposelessly<br>
    And it is not by any concitation<br>
    Of the backward devils.<br>
    I would meet you upon this honestly.<br>
    I that was near your heart was removed therefrom<br>
    To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.<br>
    I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it<br>
    Since what is kept must be adulterated?<br>
    I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:<br>
    How should I use it for your closer contact?<br><br>

    These with a thousand small deliberations<br>
    Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,<br>
    Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,<br>
    With pungent sauces, multiply variety<br>
    In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,<br>
    Suspend its operations, will the weevil<br>
    Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled<br>
    Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear<br>
    In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits<br>
    Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,<br>
    White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,<br>
    And an old man driven by the Trades<br>
    To a sleepy corner.<br><br>

    Tenants of the house,<br>
    Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.

  <h2 class="title">Rhapsody On A Windy Night</h2>

  <p>
    Twelve o'clock.<br>
    Along the reaches of the street<br>
    Held in a lunar synthesis,<br>
    Whispering lunar incantations<br>
    Dissolve the floors of memory<br>
    And all its clear relations<br>
    Its divisions and precisions,<br>
    Every street lamp that I pass<br>
    Beats like a fatalistic drum,<br>
    And through the spaces of the dark<br>
    Midnight shakes the memory<br>
    As a madman shakes a dead geranium.<br><br>

    Half-past one,<br>
    The street-lamp sputtered,<br>
    The street-lamp muttered,<br>
    The street-lamp said, "Regard that woman<br>
    Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door<br>
    Which opens on her like a grin.<br>
    You see the border of her dress<br>
    Is torn and stained with sand,<br>
    And you see the corner of her eye<br>
    Twists like a crooked pin."<br><br>

    The memory throws up high and dry<br>
    A crowd of twisted things;<br><br>

    A twisted branch upon the beach<br>
    Eaten smooth, and polished<br>
    As if the world gave up<br>
    The secret of its skeleton,<br>
    Stiff and white.<br>
    A broken spring in a factory yard,<br>
    Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left<br>
    Hard and curled and ready to snap.<br><br>

    Half-past two,<br>
    The street lamp said,<br>
    "Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,<br>
    Slips out its tongue<br>
    And devours a morsel of rancid butter."<br>
    So the hand of the child, automatic,<br>
    Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.<br>
    I could see nothing behind that child’s eye.<br>
    I have seen eyes in the street<br>
    Trying to peer through lighted shutters,<br>
    And a crab one afternoon in a pool,<br>
    An old crab with barnacles on his back,<br>
    Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.<br><br>

    Half-past three,<br>
    The lamp sputtered,<br>
    The lamp muttered in the dark.<br>
    The lamp hummed:<br>
    "Regard the moon,<br>
    La lune ne guarde aucune rancune,<br>
    She winks a feeble eye,<br>
    She smiles into corners.<br>
    She smooths the hair of the grass.<br>
    The moon has lost her memory.<br>
    A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,<br>
    Her hand twists a paper rose,<br>
    That smells of dust and eau de Cologne,<br>
    She is alone<br>
    With all the old nocturnal smells<br>
    That cross and cross across her brain."<br>
    The reminiscence comes<br>
    Of sunless dry geraniums<br>
    And dust in crevices,<br>
    Smells of chestnuts in the streets,<br>
    And female smells in shuttered rooms,<br>
    And cigarettes in corridors<br>
    And cocktail smells in bars.<br><br>

    The lamp said,<br>
    "Four o'clock,<br>
    Here is the number on the door.<br>
    Memory!<br>
    You have the key,<br>
    The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair.<br>
    Mount.<br>
    The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,<br>
    Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."<br><br>

    The last twist of the knife.

    The winter's evening settles down<br>
    With smells of steaks in passageways.<br>
    Six o'clock.<br>
    The burnt-out ends of smoky days.<br>
    And now a gusty shower wraps<br>
    The grimy scraps<br>
    Of withered leaves across your feet<br>
    And newspapers from vacant lots;<br>
    The showers beat<br>
    On empty blinds and chimney-pots,<br>
    And at the corner of the street<br>
    A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.<br>
    And then the lighting of the lamps.<br>
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">II</h3>
  <p>
    The morning comes to consciousness<br>
    Of faint stale smells of beer<br>
    From the sawdust-trampled street<br>
    With all the muddy feet that press<br>
    To early coffee-stands.<br>
    With the other masquerades<br>
    That time resumes,<br>
    One thinks of all the hands<br>
    That are raising dingy shades<br>
    In a thousand furnished rooms.<br>

  <h3 class="section-title">III</h3>
  <p>
    You tossed a blanket from the bed,<br>
    You lay upon your back, and waited;<br>
    You dozed, and watched the night revealing<br>
    The thousand sordid images<br>
    Of which your soul is constituted;<br>
    They flickered against the ceiling.<br>
    And when all the world came back<br>
    And the light crept up between the shutters<br>
    And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,<br>
    You had such a vision of the street<br>
    As the street hardly understands;<br>
    Sitting along the bed's edge, where<br>
    You curled the papers from your hair,<br>
    And clasped the yellowed soles of feet<br>
    In the palms of both soiled hands.<br>
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">IV</h3>
  <p>
    His soul stretched tight across the skies<br>
    That fade behind a city block,<br>
    Or trampled by insistent feet<br>
    At four and five and six o'clock,<br>
    And short square fingers stuffing pipes<br>
    And evening newspapers, and eyes<br>
    Assured of certain certainties,<br>
    The conscience of a blackened street<br>
    Impatient to assume the world.<br><br>

    I am moved by fancies that are curled<br>
    Around these images, and cling:<br>
    The notion of some infinitely gentle<br>
    Infinitely suffering thing.<br><br>

    Wipe your hand across your mouth and laugh;<br>
    The worlds revolve like ancient women<br>
    Gathering fuel in vacant lots.<br>

  <p>
    I sit in the top of the wood, my eyes closed.<br>
    Inaction, no falsifying dream<br>
    Between my hooked head and hooked feet:<br>
    Or in sleep rehearse perfect kills and eat.<br><br>

    The convenience of the high trees!<br>
    The air's buoyancy and the sun's ray<br>
    Are of advantage to me;<br>
    And the earth's face upward for my inspection.<br><br>

    My feet are locked upon the rough bark.<br>
    It took the whole of Creation<br>
    To produce my foot, my each feather:<br>
    Now I hold Creation in my foot<br><br>

    Or fly up, and revolve it all slowly -<br>
    I kill where I please because it is all mine.<br>
    There is no sophistry in my body:<br>
    My manners are tearing off heads -<br><br>

    The allotment of death.<br>
    For the one path of my flight is direct<br>
    Through the bones of the living.<br>
    No arguments assert my right:<br><br>

  <h2 class="title">Tractor</h2>

  <p>
    The tractor stands frozen - an agony<br>
    To think of. All night<br>
    Snow packed its open entrails. Now a head-pincering gale,<br>
    A spill of molten ice, smoking snow,<br>
    Pours into its steel.<br>
    At white heat of numbness it stands<br>
    In the aimed hosing of ground-level fieriness.<br><br>

    It defied flesh and won't start.<br>
    Hands are like wounds already<br>
    Inside armour gloves, and feet are unbelievable<br>
    As if the toe-nails were all just torn off.<br>
    I stare at it in hatred. Beyond it<br>
    The copse hisses - capitulates miserably<br>
    In the fleeing, failing light. Starlings,<br>
    A dirtier sleetier snow, blow smokily, unendingly, over<br>
    Towards plantations Eastward.<br>
    All the time the tractor is sinking<br>
    Through the degrees, deepening<br>
    Into its hell of ice.<br><br>

    The starting lever<br>
    Cracks its action, like a snapping knuckle.<br>
    The battery is alive - but like a lamb<br>
    Trying to nudge its solid-frozen mother -<br>
    While the seat claims my buttock-bones, bites<br>
    With the space-cold of earth, which it has joined<br>
    In one solid lump.<br><br>

    I squirt commercial sure-fire<br>
    Down the black throat - it just coughs.<br>
    It ridicules me - a trap of iron stupidity<br>
    I've stepped into. I drive the battery<br>
    As if I were hammering and hammering<br>
    The frozen arrangement to pieces with a hammer<br>
    And it jabbers laughing pain-crying mockingly<br>
    Into happy life.<br><br>

    And stands<br>
    Shuddering itself full of heat, seeming to enlarge slowly<br>
    Like a demon demonstrating<br>
    A more-than-usually-complete materialization -<br>
    Suddenly it jerks from its solidarity<br>
    With the concrete, and lurches towards a stanchion<br>
    Bursting with superhuman well-being and abandon<br>
    Shouting Where Where?<br><br>

    Worse iron is waiting. Power-lift kneels<br>
    Levers awake imprisoned deadweight,<br>
    Shackle-pins bedded in cast-iron cow-shit.<br>
    The blind and vibrating condemned obedience<br>
    Of iron to the cruelty of iron,<br>
    Wheels screeched out of their night-locks -<br><br>

    Fingers<br>
    Among the tormented<br>
    Tonnage and burning of iron<br><br>

    Eyes<br>
    Weeping in the wind of chloroform<br><br>

    And the tractor, streaming with sweat,<br>
    Raging and trembling and rejoicing.

    She gives him his eyes, she found them<br>
    Among some rubble, among some beetles<br><br>

    He gives her her skin<br>
    He just seemed to pull it down out of the air and lay it over her<br>
    She weeps with fearfulness and astonishment<br><br>

    She has found his hands for him, and fitted them freshly at the wrists<br>
    They are amazed at themselves, they go feeling all over her<br><br>

    He has assembled her spine, he cleaned each piece carefully<br>
    And sets them in perfect order<br>
    A superhuman puzzle but he is inspired<br>
    She leans back twisting this way and that, using it and laughing<br>
    Incredulous<br><br>

    Now she has brought his feet, she is connecting them<br>
    So that his whole body lights up<br><br>

    And he has fashioned her new hips<br>
    With all fittings complete and with newly wound coils, all shiningly oiled<br>
    He is polishing every part, he himself can hardly believe it<br><br>

    They keep taking each other to the sun, they find they can easily<br>
    To test each new thing at each new step<br><br>

    And now she smoothes over him the plates of his skull<br>
    So that the joints are invisible<br><br>

    And now he connects her throat, her breasts and the pit of her stomach<br>
    With a single wire<br><br>

    She gives him his teeth, tying the roots to the centrepin of his body<br><br>

    He sets the little circlets on her fingertips<br><br>

    She stitches his body here and there with steely purple silk<br><br>

    He oils the delicate cogs of her mouth<br><br>

    She inlays with deep cut scrolls the nape of his neck<br><br>

    He sinks into place the inside of her thighs<br><br>

    So, gasping with joy, with cries of wonderment<br>
    Like two gods of mud<br>
    Sprawling in the dirt, but with infinite care<br>
    They bring each other to perfection.

  <p>
    This house has been far out at sea all night,<br>
    The woods crashing through darkness, the booming hills,<br>
    Winds stampeding the fields under the window<br>
    Floundering black astride and blinding wet<br><br>

    Till day rose; then under an orange sky<br>
    The hills had new places, and wind wielded<br>
    Blade-light, luminous black and emerald,<br>
    Flexing like the lens of a mad eye.<br><br>

    At noon I scaled along the house-side as far as<br>
    The coal-house door. Once I looked up -<br>
    Through the brunt wind that dented the balls of my eyes<br>
    The tent of the hills drummed and strained its guyrope,<br><br>

    The fields quivering, the skyline a grimace,<br>
    At any second to bang and vanish with a flap;<br>
    The wind flung a magpie away and a black-<br>
    Back gull bent like an iron bar slowly. The house<br><br>

    Rang like some fine green goblet in the note<br>
    That any second would shatter it. Now deep<br>
    In chairs, in front of the great fire, we grip<br>
    Our hearts and cannot entertain book, thought,<br><br>

    Or each other. We watch the fire blazing,<br>
    And feel the roots of the house move, but sit on,<br>
    Seeing the window tremble to come in,<br>
    Hearing the stones cry out under the horizons.

  <h2 class="title">Lovesong</h2>

  <p>
    He loved her and she loved him.<br>
    His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to<br>
    He had no other appetite<br>
    She bit him she gnawed him she sucked<br>
    She wanted him complete inside her<br>
    Safe and sure forever and ever<br>
    Their little cries fluttered into the curtains<br><br>

    Her eyes wanted nothing to get away<br>
    Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows<br>
    He gripped her hard so that life<br>
    Should not drag her from that moment<br>
    He wanted all future to cease<br>
    He wanted to topple with his arms round her<br>
    Off that moment's brink and into nothing<br>
    Or everlasting or whatever there was<br><br>

    Her embrace was an immense press<br>
    To print him into her bones<br>
    His smiles were the garrets of a fairy palace<br>
    Where the real world would never come<br>
    Her smiles were spider bites<br>
    So he would lie still till she felt hungry<br>
    His words were occupying armies<br>
    Her laughs were an assassin's attempts<br>
    His looks were bullets daggers of revenge<br>
    His glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets<br>
    His whispers were whips and jackboots<br>
    Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing<br>
    His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway<br>
    Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks<br>
    And their deep cries crawled over the floors<br>
    Like an animal dragging a great trap<br>
    His promises were the surgeon's gag<br>
    Her promises took the top off his skull<br>
    She would get a brooch made of it<br>
    His vows pulled out all her sinews<br>
    He showed her how to make a love-knot<br>
    Her vows put his eyes in formalin<br>
    At the back of her secret drawer<br>
    Their screams stuck in the wall<br><br>

    Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves<br>
    Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop<br><br>

    In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs<br>
    In their dreams their brains took each other hostage<br><br>

    In the morning they wore each other's face

  <h2 class="title">How To Paint A Water Lily</h2>

  <p>
    To Paint a Water Lily<br><br>

    A green level of lily leaves<br>
    Roofs the pond's chamber and paves<br><br>

    The flies' furious arena: study<br>
    These, the two minds of this lady.<br><br>

    First observe the air's dragonfly<br>
    That eats meat, that bullets by<br><br>

    Or stands in space to take aim;<br>
    Others as dangerous comb the hum<br><br>

    Under the trees.  There are battle-shouts<br>
    And death-cries everywhere hereabouts<br><br>

    But inaudible, so the eyes praise<br>
    To see the colours of these flies<br><br>

    Rainbow their arcs, spark, or settle<br>
    Cooling like beads of molten metal<br><br>

    Through the spectrum.  Think what worse<br>
    is the pond-bed's matter of course;<br><br>

    Prehistoric bedragoned times<br>
    Crawl that darkness with Latin names,<br><br>

    Have evolved no improvements there,<br>
    Jaws for heads, the set stare,<br><br>

    Ignorant of age as of hour—<br>
    Now paint the long-necked lily-flower<br><br>

    Which, deep in both worlds, can be still<br>
    As a painting, trembling hardly at all<br><br>

    Though the dragonfly alight,<br>
    Whatever horror nudge her root.

  <p>
    A cool small evening shrunk to a dog bark and the clank of a bucket -<br>
    And you listening.<br><br>
    A spider's web, tense for the dew's touch.<br>
    A pail lifted, still and brimming - mirror<br>
    To tempt a first star to a tremor.<br><br>
    
    Cows are going home in the lane there, looping the hedges with their warm<br>
    wreaths of breath -<br>
    A dark river of blood, many boulders,<br>
    Balancing unspilled milk.<br>
    'Moon!' you cry suddenly, 'Moon!  Moon!'<br><br>
    
    The moon has stepped back like an artist gazing amazed at a work<br>
    That points at him amazed.

  <h2 class="title">Macaw and Little Miss</h2>
  
  <p>
    In a cage of wire-ribs<br>
    The size of a man's head, the macaw bristles in a staring<br>
    Combustion, suffers the stoking devils of his eyes.<br>
    In the old lady's parlour, where an aspidistra succumbs<br>
    To the musk of faded velvet, he hangs in clear flames,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a torturer's iron instrument preparing<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dense slow shudderings of greens, yellows, blues,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimsoning into the barbs:<br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or like the smouldering head that hung<br>
    In Killdevil's brass kitchen, in irons, who had been<br>
    Volcano swearing to vomit the world away in black ash,<br>
    And would, one day; or a fugitive aristocrat<br>
    From some thunderous mythological hierarchy, caught<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a little boy with a crust and a bent pin,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or snare of horsehair set for a song-thrush,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put in a cage to sing.<br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady who feeds him seeds<br>
    Has a grand-daughter. The girl calls him 'Poor Polly', pokes fun.<br>
    'Jolly Mop.' But lies under every full moon,<br>
    The spun glass of her body bared and so gleam-still<br>
    Her brimming eyes do not tremble or spill<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream where the warrior comes, lightning and iron,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smashing and burning and rending towards her loin:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep into her pillow her silence pleads.<br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day he stares at his furnace<br>
    With eyes red-raw, but when she comes they close.<br>
    'Polly. Pretty Poll', she cajoles, and rocks him gently.<br>
    She caresses, whispers kisses. The blue lids stay shut.<br>
    She strikes the cage in a tantrum and swirls out:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly beak, wings, talons crash<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bars in conflagration and frenzy,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his shriek shakes the house.<br>

    Against the rubber tongues of cows and the hoeing hands of men<br>
    Thistles spike the summer air<br>
    And crackle open under a blue-black pressure.<br><br>

    Every one a revengeful burst<br>
    Of resurrection, a grasped fistful<br>
    Of splintered weapons and Icelandic frost thrust up<br><br>

    From the underground stain of a decayed Viking.<br>
    They are like pale hair and the gutturals of dialects.<br>
    Every one manages a plume of blood.<br><br>

    Then they grow grey like men.<br>
    Mown down, it is a feud. Their sons appear<br>
    Stiff with weapons, fighting back over the same ground.<br>

    I imagine this midnight moment's forest:<br>
    Something else is alive<br>
    Beside the clock's loneliness<br>
    And this blank page where my fingers move.<br><br>

    Through the window I see no star:<br>
    Something more near<br>
    Though deeper within darkness<br>
    Is entering the loneliness:<br><br>

    Cold, delicately as the dark snow<br>
    A fox's nose touches twig, leaf;<br>
    Two eyes serve a movement, that now<br>
    And again now, and now, and now<br><br>

    Sets neat prints into the snow<br>
    Between trees, and warily a lame<br>
    Shadow lags by stump and in hollow<br>
    Of a body that is bold to come<br><br>

    Across clearings, an eye,<br>
    A widening deepening greenness,<br>
    Brilliantly, concentratedly,<br>
    Coming about its own business<br><br>

    Till, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox<br>
    It enters the dark hole of the head.<br>
    The window is starless still; the clock ticks,<br>
    The page is printed.<br>

    When Crow was white he decided the sun was too white.<br>
    He decided it glared much too whitely.<br>
    He decided to attack it and defeat it.<br><br>
    
    He got his strength up flush and in full glitter.<br>
    He clawed and fluffed his rage up.<br>
    He aimed his beak direct at the sun's centre.<br><br>
    
    He laughed himself to the centre of himself<br>
    And attacked.<br><br>
    
    At his battle cry trees grew suddenly old,<br>
    Shadows flattened.<br><br>
    
    But the sun brightened—<br>
    It brightened, and Crow returned charred black.<br><br>
    
    He opened his mouth but what came out was charred black.<br><br>

  <p>
    I saw my world again through your eyes<br>
    As I would see it again through your children's eyes.<br>
    Through your eyes it was foreign.<br>
    Plain hedge hawthorns were peculiar aliens,<br>
    A mystery of peculiar lore and doings.<br>
    Anything wild, on legs, in your eyes<br>
    Emerged at a point of exclamation<br>
    As if it had appeared to dinner guests<br>
    In the middle of the table. Common mallards<br>
    Were artefacts of some unearthliness,<br>
    Their wooings were a hypnagogic film<br>
    Unreeled by the river. Impossible<br>
    To comprehend the comfort of their feet<br>
    In the freezing water. You were a camera<br>
    Recording reflections you could not fathom.<br>
    I made my world perform its utmost for you.<br>
    You took it all in with an incredulous joy<br>
    Like a mother handed her new baby<br>
    By the midwife. Your frenzy made me giddy.<br>
    It woke up my dumb, ecstatic boyhood<br>
    Of fifteen years before. My masterpiece<br>
    Came that black night on the Grantchester road.<br>
    I sucked the throaty thin woe of a rabbit<br>
    Out of my wetted knuckle, by a copse<br>
    Where a tawny owl was enquiring.<br>
    Suddenly it swooped up, splaying its pinions<br>
    Into my face, taking me for a post.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a seed in a sunflower.<br>

  <p>
    I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.<br>
    Whatever I see I swallow immediately<br>
    Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.<br>
    I am not cruel, only truthful‚<br>
    The eye of a little god, four-cornered.<br>
    Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.<br>
    It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long<br>
    I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.<br>
    Faces and darkness separate us over and over.<br><br>

    Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,<br>
    Searching my reaches for what she really is.<br>
    Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.<br>
    I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.<br>
    She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.<br>
    I am important to her. She comes and goes.<br>
    Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.<br>
    In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman<br>
    Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.

  <p>
    I have done it again.<br>
    One year in every ten<br>
    I manage it——<br><br>

    A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>
    Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>
    My right foot<br><br>

    A paperweight,<br>
    My face a featureless, fine<br>
    Jew linen.<br><br>

    Peel off the napkin<br>
    O my enemy.<br>
    Do I terrify?——<br><br>

    The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>
    The sour breath<br>
    Will vanish in a day.<br><br>

    Soon, soon the flesh<br>
    The grave cave ate will be<br>
    At home on me<br><br>

    And I a smiling woman.<br>
    I am only thirty.<br>
    And like the cat I have nine times to die.<br><br>

    This is Number Three.<br>
    What a trash<br>
    To annihilate each decade.<br><br>

    What a million filaments.<br>
    The peanut-crunching crowd<br>
    Shoves in to see<br><br>

    Them unwrap me hand and foot<br>
    The big strip tease.<br>
    Gentlemen, ladies<br><br>

    These are my hands<br>
    My knees.<br>
    I may be skin and bone,<br><br>

    Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br>
    The first time it happened I was ten.<br>
    It was an accident.<br><br>

    The second time I meant<br>
    To last it out and not come back at all.<br>
    I rocked shut<br><br>

    As a seashell.<br>
    They had to call and call<br>
    And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.<br><br>

    Dying<br>
    Is an art, like everything else,<br>
    I do it exceptionally well.<br><br>

    I do it so it feels like hell.<br>
    I do it so it feels real.<br>
    I guess you could say I've a call.<br><br>

    It's easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
    It's easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>
    It's the theatrical<br><br>

    Comeback in broad day<br>
    To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>
    Amused shout:<br><br>

    'A miracle!'<br>
    That knocks me out.<br>
    There is a charge<br><br>

    For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>
    For the hearing of my heart——<br>
    It really goes.<br><br>

    And there is a charge, a very large charge<br>
    For a word or a touch<br>
    Or a bit of blood<br><br>

    Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br>
    So, so, Herr Doktor.<br>
    So, Herr Enemy.<br><br>

    I am your opus,<br>
    I am your valuable,<br>
    The pure gold baby<br><br>

    That melts to a shriek.<br>
    I turn and burn.<br>
    Do not think I underestimate your great concern.<br><br>

    Ash, ash —-<br>
    You poke and stir.<br>
    Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——<br><br>

    A cake of soap,<br>
    A wedding ring,<br>
    A gold filling.<br><br>

    Herr God, Herr Lucifer<br>
    Beware<br>
    Beware.<br><br>

    Out of the ash<br>
    I rise with my red hair<br>
    And I eat men like air.

    I have always been scared of you,<br>

    Not God but a swastika<br>
    So black no sky could squeak through.<br>
    Every woman adores a Fascist,<br>
    The boot in the face, the brute<br>
    Brute heart of a brute like you.<br><br>

    You stand at the blackboard, daddy,<br>
    In the picture I have of you,<br>
    A cleft in your chin instead of your foot<br>
    But no less a devil for that, no not<br>
    Any less the black man who<br><br>

    Bit my pretty red heart in two.<br>
    I was ten when they buried you.<br>
    At twenty I tried to die<br>

    But they pulled me out of the sack,<br>
    And they stuck me together with glue.<br>
    And then I knew what to do.<br>
    I made a model of you,<br>
    A man in black with a Meinkampf look<br><br>

    And a love of the rack and the screw.<br>
    And I said I do, I do.<br>
    So daddy, I'm finally through.<br>
    The black telephone's off at the root,<br>
    The voices just can't worm through.<br><br>

    If I've killed one man, I've killed two——<br>
    The vampire who said he was you<br>
    And drank my blood for a year,<br>
    Seven years, if you want to know.<br>
    Daddy, you can lie back now.<br><br>

    There's a stake in your fat black heart<br>
    And the villagers never liked you.<br>
    They are dancing and stamping on you.<br>
    They always knew it was you.<br>
    Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.

  <h2 class="title">Cinderella</h2>

  <p>
    The prince leans to the girl in scarlet heels,<br>
    Her green eyes slant, hair flaring in a fan<br>
    Of silver as the rondo slows; now reels<br>
    Begin on tilted violins to span<br><br>

    The whole revolving tall glass palace hall<br>
    Where guests slide gliding into light like wine;<br>
    Rose candles flicker on the lilac wall<br>
    Reflecting in a million flagons' shine,<br><br>

    And glided couples all in whirling trance<br>
    Follow holiday revel begun long since,<br>
    Until near twelve the strange girl all at once<br>
    Guilt-stricken halts, pales, clings to the prince<br><br>

    As amid the hectic music and cocktail talk<br>
    She hears the caustic ticking of the clock.

<div class="poem">
  <h2 class="title">Tulips</h2>

  <p>
    The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.<br>
    Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in<br>
    I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly<br>
    As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.<br>
    I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.<br>
    I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses<br>
    And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.<br><br>

    They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff<br>
    Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.<br>
    Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.<br>
    The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,<br>
    They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,<br>
    Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,<br>
    So it is impossible to tell how many there are.<br><br>

    My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water<br>
    Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.<br>
    They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.<br>
    Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage ——<br>
    My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,<br>
    My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;<br>
    Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.<br><br>

    I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat<br>
    Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.<br>
    They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.<br>
    Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley<br>
    I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books<br>
    Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.<br>
    I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.<br><br>

    I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted<br>
    To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.<br>
    How free it is, you have no idea how free ——<br>
    The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,<br>
    And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.<br>
    It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them<br>
    Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.<br><br>

    The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.<br>
    Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe<br>
    Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.<br>
    Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.<br>
    They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,<br>
    Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour,<br>
    A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.<br><br>

    Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.<br>
    The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me<br>
    Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,<br>
    And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow<br>
    Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,<br>
    And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.<br>
    The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.<br><br>

    Before they came the air was calm enough,<br>
    Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.<br>
    Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.<br>
    Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river<br>
    Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.<br>
    They concentrate my attention, that was happy<br>
    Playing and resting without committing itself.<br><br>

    The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.<br>
    The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;<br>
    They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,<br>
    And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes<br>
    Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.<br>
    The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea,<br>
    And comes from a country far away as health.

<div class="poem">
  <h2 class="title">A Birthday Present</h2>

  <p>
    What is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful?<br>
    It is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges?<br><br>

    I am sure it is unique, I am sure it is what I want.<br>
    When I am quiet at my cooking I feel it looking, I feel it thinking<br><br>

    'Is this the one I am to appear for,<br>
    Is this the elect one, the one with black eye-pits and a scar?<br><br>

    Measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus,<br>
    Adhering to rules, to rules, to rules.<br><br>

    Is this the one for the annunciation?<br>
    My god, what a laugh!'<br><br>

    But it shimmers, it does not stop, and I think it wants me.<br>
    I would not mind if it were bones, or a pearl button.<br><br>

    I do not want much of a present, anyway, this year.<br>
    After all I am alive only by accident.<br><br>

    I would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way.<br>
    Now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,<br><br>

    The diaphanous satins of a January window<br>
    White as babies' bedding and glittering with dead breath. O ivory!<br><br>

    It must be a tusk there, a ghost column.<br>
    Can you not see I do not mind what it is.<br><br>

    Can you not give it to me?<br>
    Do not be ashamed—I do not mind if it is small.<br><br>

    Do not be mean, I am ready for enormity.<br>
    Let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,<br><br>

    The glaze, the mirrory variety of it.<br>
    Let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate.<br><br>

    I know why you will not give it to me,<br>
    You are terrified<br><br>

    The world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it,<br>
    Bossed, brazen, an antique shield,<br><br>

    A marvel to your great-grandchildren.<br>
    Do not be afraid, it is not so.<br><br>

    I will only take it and go aside quietly.<br>
    You will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,<br><br>

    No falling ribbons, no scream at the end.<br>
    I do not think you credit me with this discretion.<br><br>

    If you only knew how the veils were killing my days.<br>
    To you they are only transparencies, clear air.<br><br>

    But my god, the clouds are like cotton.<br>
    Armies of them. They are carbon monoxide.<br><br>

    Sweetly, sweetly I breathe in,<br>
    Filling my veins with invisibles, with the million<br><br>

    Probable motes that tick the years off my life.<br>
    You are silver-suited for the occasion. O adding machine——-<br><br>

    Is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole?<br>
    Must you stamp each piece purple,<br><br>

    Must you kill what you can?<br>
    There is one thing I want today, and only you can give it to me.<br><br>

    It stands at my window, big as the sky.<br>
    It breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center<br><br>

    Where split lives congeal and stiffen to history.<br>
    Let it not come by the mail, finger by finger.<br><br>

    Let it not come by word of mouth, I should be sixty<br>
    By the time the whole of it was delivered, and too numb to use it.<br><br>

    Only let down the veil, the veil, the veil.<br>
    If it were death<br><br>

    I would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes.<br>
    I would know you were serious.<br><br>

    There would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday.<br>
    And the knife not carve, but enter<br><br>

    Pure and clean as the cry of a baby,<br>
    And the universe slide from my side.

  <h2 class="title">Suicide Off Egg Rock</h2>

  <p>
    Behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled<br>
    On the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats,<br>
    Gas tanks, factory stacks— that landscape<br>
    Of imperfections his bowels were part of—<br>
    Rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught.<br>
    Sun struck the water like a damnation.<br>
    No pit of shadow to crawl into,<br>
    And his blood beating the old tattoo<br>
    I am, I am, I am. Children<br>
    Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift<br>
    Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave.<br>
    A mongrel working his legs to a gallop<br>
    Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.<br><br>

    He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold,<br>
    His body beached with the sea's garbage,<br>
    A machine to breathe and beat forever.<br>
    Flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole<br>
    Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber.<br>
    The words in his book wormed off the pages.<br>
    Everything glittered like blank paper.<br><br>

    Everything shrank in the sun's corrosive<br>
    Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage.<br>
    He heard when he walked into the water<br><br>

    The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.

  <h2 class="title">The Rabbit Catcher</h2>

  <p>
    It was a place of force—<br>
    The wind gagging my mouth with my own blown hair,<br>
    Tearing off my voice, and the sea<br>
    Blinding me with its lights, the lives of the dead<br>
    Unreeling in it, spreading like oil.<br><br>

    I tasted the malignity of the gorse,<br>
    Its black spikes,<br>
    The extreme unction of its yellow candle-flowers.<br>
    They had an efficiency, a great beauty,<br>
    And were extravagant, like torture.<br><br>

    There was only one place to get to.<br>
    Simmering, perfumed,<br>
    The paths narrowed into the hollow.<br>
    And the snares almost effaced themselves—<br>
    Zeros, shutting on nothing,<br><br>

    Set close, like birth pangs.<br>
    The absence of shrieks<br>
    Made a hole in the hot day, a vacancy.<br>
    The glassy light was a clear wall,<br>
    The thickets quiet.<br><br>

    I felt a still busyness, an intent.<br>
    I felt hands round a tea mug, dull, blunt,<br>
    Ringing the white china.<br>
    How they awaited him, those little deaths!<br>
    They waited like sweethearts. They excited him.<br><br>

    And we, too, had a relationship—<br>
    Tight wires between us,<br>
    Pegs too deep to uproot, and a mind like a ring<br>
    Sliding shut on some quick thing,<br>
    The constriction killing me also.

  <h2 class="title">Morning Song</h2>

  <p>
    Love set you going like a fat gold watch.<br>
    The midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry<br>
    Took its place among the elements.<br><br>

    Our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. New statue.<br>
    In a drafty museum, your nakedness<br>
    Shadows our safety. We stand round blankly as walls.<br><br>

    I'm no more your mother<br>
    Than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow<br>
    Effacement at the wind's hand.<br><br>

    All night your moth-breath<br>
    Flickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:<br>
    A far sea moves in my ear.<br><br>

    One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral<br>
    In my Victorian nightgown.<br>
    Your mouth opens clean as a cat's. The window square<br><br>

    Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now you try<br>
    Your handful of notes;<br>
    The clear vowels rise like balloons.

    The woman is perfected<br>
    Her dead<br><br>

    Body wears the smile of accomplishment,<br>
    The illusion of a Greek necessity<br><br>

    Flows in the scrolls of her toga,<br>
    Her bare<br><br>

    Feet seem to be saying:<br>
    We have come so far, it is over.<br><br>

    Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,<br>
    One at each little<br><br>

    Pitcher of milk, now empty<br>
    She has folded<br><br>

    Them back into her body as petals<br>
    Of a rose close when the garden<br><br>

    Stiffens and odors bleed<br>
    From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.<br><br>

    The moon has nothing to be sad about,<br>
    Staring from her hood of bone.<br><br>

    She is used to this sort of thing.<br>
    Her blacks crackle and drag.

    The stars go waltzing out in blue and red,<br>
    And arbitrary blackness gallops in:<br>
    I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead.<br><br>

    I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed<br>
    And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane.<br>
    (I think I made you up inside my head.)<br><br>

    God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade:<br>
    Exit seraphim and Satan's men:<br>

  <p>
    The night is only a sort of carbon paper,<br>
    Blueblack, with the much-poked periods of stars<br>
    Letting in the light, peephole after peephole...<br>
    A bonewhite light, like death, behind all things.<br>
    Under the eyes of the stars and the moon's rictus<br>
    He suffers his desert pillow, sleeplessness<br>
    Stretching its fine, irritating sand in all directions.<br><br>

    Over and over the old, granular movie<br>
    Exposes embarrassment - the mizzling days<br>
    Of childhood and adolescence, sticky with dreams,<br>
    Parental faces on tall stalks, alternately stern and tearful,<br>
    A garden of buggy rose that made him cry.<br>
    His forehead is bumpy as a sack of rocks.<br>
    Memories jostle each other for face-room like obsolete film stars.<br><br>

    He is immune to pills: red, purple, blue...<br>
    How they lit the tedium of the protracted evening!<br>
    Those sugary planets whose influence won for him<br>
    A life baptized in no-life for a while,<br>
    And the sweet, drugged waking of a forgetful baby.<br>
    Now the pills are worn-out and silly, like classical gods.<br>
    Their poppy-sleepy colors do him no good.<br><br>

    His head is a little interior of grey mirrors.<br>
    Each gesture flees immediately down an alley<br>
    Of diminishing perspectives, and its significance<br>
    Drains like water out the hole at the far end.<br>
    He lives without privacy in a lidless room,<br>
    The bald slots of his eyes stiffened wide-open<br>
    On the incessant heat-lightning flicker of situations.<br><br>

    Nightlong, in the granite yard, invisible cats<br>
    Have been howling like women, or damaged instruments.<br>
    Already he can feel daylight, his white disease,<br>
    Creeping up with her hatful of trivial repetitions.<br>
    The city is a map of cheerful twitters now,<br>
    And everywhere people, eyes mica-silver and blank,<br>
    Are riding to work in rows, as if recently brainwashed.
